### Operating an XRP Ledger server securely

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Software constantly evolves. In order to focus resources, we only generally only accept vulnerability reports that affect recent and current versions of the software. We always accept reports for issues present in the **master**, **release** or **develop** branches, and with proposed, [open pull requests](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pulls).

## Identifying and Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and we do our best to ensure that all our releases are bug free. But we aren't perfect and sometimes things will slip through.

### Responsible Investigation

We urge you to examine our code carefully and responsibly, and to disclose any issues that you identify in a responsible fashion.

Responsible investigation includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Not performing tests on the main network. If testing is necessary, use the [Testnet or Devnet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-testnet-faucet.html).
- Not targeting physical security measures, or attempting to use social engineering, spam, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc.
- Investigating bugs in a way that makes a reasonable, good faith effort not to be disruptive or harmful to the XRP Ledger and the broader ecosystem.

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability or potential threat, or if you _think_
you have, please reach out by dropping an email using the contact
information below.

Your report should include the following:

- Your contact information (typically, an email address);
- The description of the vulnerability;
- The attack scenario (if any);
- The steps to reproduce the vulnerability;
- Any other relevant details or artifacts, including code, scripts or patches.

In your mail, please describe of the issue or the potential threat; if possible, please include a "repro" (code that can reproduce the issue) or describe the best way to reproduce and replicate the issue. Please make your report as extensive as possible.

For more information on responsible disclosure, please read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

## Report Handling Process

Please report the bug directly to us and limit further disclosure. If you want to prove that you knew the bug as of a given time, consider using a cryptographic precommitment: hash the content of your report and publish the hash on a medium of your choice (e.g. on Twitter or as a memo in a transaction) as "proof" that you had written the text at a given point in time.

Once we receive a report, we:

1. Assign two people to independently evaluate the report;
2. Consider their recommendations;
3. If action is necessary, formulate a plan to address the issue;
4. Communicate privately with the reporter to explain our plan.
5. Prepare, test and release a version which fixes the issue; and
6. Announce the vulnerability publicly.

We will triage and respond to your disclosure within 24 hours. Beyond that, we will work to analyze the issue in more detail, formulate, develop and test a fix.

While we commit to responding with 24 hours of your initial report with our triage assessment, we cannot guarantee a response time for the remaining steps. We will communicate with you throughout this process, letting you know where we are and keeping you updated on the timeframe.

## Bug Bounty Program

[Ripple](https://ripple.com) is generously sponsoring a bug bounty program for vulnerabilities in [`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled) (and other related projects, like [`ripple-lib`](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib)).

This program allows us to recognize and reward individuals or groups that identify and report bugs. In summary, order to qualify for a bounty, the bug must be:

1. **In scope**. Only bugs in software under the scope of the program qualify. Currently, that means `rippled` and `ripple-lib`.
2. **Relevant**. A security issue, posing a danger to user funds, privacy or the operation of the XRP Ledger.
3. **Original and previously unknown**. Bugs that are already known and discussed in public do not qualify. Previously reported bugs, even if publicly unknown, are not eligible.
4. **Specific**. We welcome general security advice or recommendations, but we cannot pay bounties for that.
5. **Fixable**. There has to be something we can do to permanently fix the problem. Note that bugs in other people’s software may still qualify in some cases. For example, if you find a bug in a library that we use which can compromises the security of software that is in scope and we can get it fixed, you may qualify for a bounty.
6. **Unused**. If you use the exploit to attack the XRP Ledger, you do not qualify for a bounty. If you report a vulnerability used in an ongoing or past attack and there is specific, concrete evidence that suggests you are the attacker we reserve the right not to pay a bounty.

The amount paid varies dramatically. Vulnerabilities that are harmless on their own, but could form part of a critical exploit will usually receive a bounty. Full-blown exploits can receive much higher bounties. Please don’t hold back partial vulnerabilities while trying to construct a full-blown exploit. We will pay a bounty to anyone who reports a complete chain of vulnerabilities even if they have reported each component of the exploit separately and those vulnerabilities have been fixed in the meantime. However, to qualify for a the full bounty, you must to have been the first to report each of the partial exploits.
