# Beast: An amazing cross platform library

Contains cross platform objects to do a variety of useful things.
No external dependencies, no complicated build steps.

Things people need for building peer to peer, concurrent, cryptographic systems.

The hope is that this will replace the use of boost and other cumbersome jalopies.
