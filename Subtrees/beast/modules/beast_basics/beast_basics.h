### Version 1.0

Copyright 2008, 2013 by Vinnie Falco \<vinnie.falco@gmail.com\> ([e-mail][0])

Beast is a source code collection of individual modules containing
functionality for a variety of applications, with an emphasis on building
concurrent systems. Beast incorporates parts of [JUCE][3] (Jules' Utility
Class Extensions), available from [Raw Material Software][4]. Beast has no
external dependencies 

Beast is hosted on Github at [https://github.com/vinniefalco/Beast][1]

The online documentation is at [http://vinniefalco.github.com/Beast][2]

## Platforms

All platforms supported by JUCE are also supported by Beast. Currently these
platforms include:

- **Windows**: Applications and VST/RTAS/NPAPI/ActiveX plugins can be built
using MS Visual Studio. The results are all fully compatible with Windows
XP, Vista or Windows 7.

- **Mac OS X**: Applications and VST/AudioUnit/RTAS/NPAPI plugins with Xcode.

- **GNU/Linux**: Applications and plugins can be built for any kernel 2.6 or
later.

- **FreeBSD**: Kernel version 8.4 or higher required.

- **iOS**: Native iPhone and iPad apps.

- **Android**: Supported.

## Prerequisites

This documentation assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of JUCE.
Some modules built on external libraries assume that the reader understands
the operation of those external libraries. Certain modules assume that the
reader understands additional domain-specific information. Modules with
additional prerequisites are marked in the documentation.

## External Modules

Some modules bring in functionality provided by external libraries. For
example, the @ref beast_bzip2 module provides the compression and decompression
algorithms in [bZip2][7]. Usage of these external library modules is optional.
They come with complete source code, as well as options for using either
system or user provided variants of the external libraries: it is not
necessary to download additional source code packages to use these modules.

External code incorporated into Beast is covered by separate licenses. See
the licensing information and notes in the corresponding source files for
copyright information and terms of use.

## Integration

Beast requires recent versions of JUCE. It won't work with versions 1.53 or
earlier. To use the library it is necessary to first download JUCE to a
location where your development environment can find it. Or, you can use your
existing installation of JUCE.

This library uses the same modularized organizational structure as JUCE. To
use a module, first add a path to the list of includes searched by your
development environment or project, which points to the Beast directory. Then,
add the single corresponding .c or .cpp file to your existing project which
already uses JUCE. For example, to use the @ref beast_core module, add the file
beast_core.cpp to your project. Some modules depend on other modules.

To use a module, include the appropriate header from within your source code.
For example, to access classes in the @ref beast_concurrent module, use this:

@code

#include "modules/beast_concurrent/beast_concurrent.h"

@endcode

Then add the corresponding file beast_concurrent.cpp to your build.

## AppConfig

Some Beast features can be controlled at compilation time through
preprocessor directives. The available choices of compilation options are
described in AppConfig.h, located in the AppConfigTemplate directory. Copy
the provided settings into your existing AppConfig.h (a file used by JUCE
convention).

## License

separate licenses. Please see the corresponding source files for specific
