# What is Ripple?
Ripple connects banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.

# What is the XRP Ledger?
The XRP Ledger is a network of computers, which uses [a consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0) to atomically settle and record transactions on a secure distributed database. Because of its distributed nature, the XRP Ledger offers transaction immutability without a central operator. The XRP Ledger contains a built-in currency exchange and its path-finding algorithm finds competitive exchange rates across order books and currency pairs.

### Key Features
- **Distributed**
  - Direct account-to-account settlement with no central operator
  - Decentralized global market for competitive FX
- **Secure**
  - Transactions are cryptographically signed using ECDSA or Ed25519
  - Multi-signing capabilities
- **Scalable**
  - Capacity to process the world’s cross-border payments volume
  - Easy access to liquidity through a competitive FX marketplace

## Global payments
Ripple connects banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates via RippleNet to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally.

Ripple is built on the most advanced blockchain technology that is scalable, secure and interoperates different networks, while providing optional access to the world’s fastest and most scalable digital asset for payments, XRP.

Banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges process and provide liquidity for payments on RippleNet, creating new, competitive cross-border payments services for their customers.

### XRP as a Bridge Currency
Built for enterprise use, XRP offers banks and payment providers a highly efficient, scalable, reliable liquidity option to service cross-border payments. Using XRP, banks can source liquidity on demand in real time without having to pre-fund nostro accounts. Ripple can bridge even exotic currency pairs directly through XRP. Payment Providers use XRP to expand reach into new markets, lower foreign exchange costs and provide faster payment settlement. 

xRapid is for payment providers and other financial institutions who want to minimize liquidity costs while improving their customer experience. Because payments into emerging markets often require pre-funded local currency accounts around the world, liquidity costs are high. xRapid dramatically lowers the capital requirements for liquidity. xRapid uses digital assets, such as XRP, to offer on-demand liquidity, which dramatically lowers costs while enabling real-time payments in emerging markets.
