               boost::optional<std::chrono::duration> (NodeId i, NodeId j)

        that returns the delay sending messages from node i to node j.

        In general, this network graph is distinct from the trust graph, but
        users can use adaptors to present a TrustGraph as a Topology by
        specifying the delay between nodes.
