/**
    Adds reference-counting to an object.

    To add reference-counting to a class, derive it from this class, and
    use the SharedPtr class to point to it.

    e.g. @code
    class MyClass : public SharedObject
    {
        void foo();

        // This is a neat way of declaring a using Ptr = for a pointer class,
        // rather than typing out the full templated name each time..
        using Ptr = SharedPtr<MyClass>;
    };

    MyClass::Ptr p = new MyClass();
    MyClass::Ptr p2 = p;
    p = nullptr;
    p2->foo();
    @endcode

    Once a new SharedObject has been assigned to a pointer, be
    careful not to delete the object manually.

    This class uses an std::atomic<int> value to hold the reference count, so
    that the pointers can be passed between threads safely.
