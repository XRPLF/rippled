/** This is the character encoding type used internally to store the string.

    By setting the value of BEAST_STRING_UTF_TYPE to 8, 16, or 32, you can change the
    internal storage format of the String class. UTF-8 uses the least space (if your strings
    contain few extended characters), but call operator[] involves iterating the string to find
    the required index. UTF-32 provides instant random access to its characters, but uses 4 bytes
    per character to store them. UTF-16 uses more space than UTF-8 and is also slow to index,
    but is the native wchar_t format used in Windows.

    It doesn't matter too much which format you pick, because the toUTF8(), toUTF16() and
    toUTF32() methods let you access the string's content in any of the other formats.
