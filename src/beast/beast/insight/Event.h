/** A metric for reporting event timing.

    An event is an operation that has an associated millisecond time, or
    other integral value. Because events happen at a specific moment, the
    metric only supports a push-style interface.

    This is a lightweight reference wrapper which is cheap to copy and assign.
    When the last reference goes away, the metric is no longer collected.
