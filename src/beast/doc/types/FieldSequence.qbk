[section:FieldSequence FieldSequence requirements]

A [*FieldSequence] is an iterable container whose value type meets
the requirements of [link beast.ref.Field [*Field]]. Objects that meet
these requirements become serializable by the implementation.

In this table:

* `X` denotes a type that meets the requirements of [*FieldSequence].

* `c` is a value of type `X const`.

[table FieldSequence requirements
[[operation][type][semantics, pre/post-conditions]]
[
    [`X::value_type`]
    []
    [
        A type that meets the requirements of [link beast.ref.Field [*Field]].
    ]
]
[
    [`X::const_iterator`]
    []
    [
        An iterator type whose `reference` type meets the
        requirements of [link beast.ref.Field [*Field]], and which
        satisfies all the requirements of [*ForwardIterator],
        except that:

        [ordered_list
            [there is no requirement that `operator->` is provided, and]
            [there is no requirement that `reference` be a reference type.]

[
    [`c.begin()`]
    [`X::const_iterator`]
    [
        Returns an iterator to the beginning of the field sequence.
    ]
]
[
    [`c.end()`]
    [`X::const_iterator`]
    [
        Returns an iterator to the end of the field sequence.
