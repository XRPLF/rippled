[section:DynamicBuffer DynamicBuffer requirements]

A dynamic buffer encapsulates memory storage that may be automatically resized
as required, where the memory is divided into an input sequence followed by an
output sequence. These memory regions are internal to the dynamic buffer, but
direct access to the elements is provided to permit them to be efficiently used
with I/O operations, such as the send or receive operations of a socket. Data
written to the output sequence of a dynamic buffer object is appended to the
input sequence of the same object.

The interface to this concept is intended to permit the following
implementation strategies:

* A single contiguous octet array, which is reallocated as necessary to
  accommodate changes in the size of the octet sequence.

* A sequence of one or more octet arrays, where each array is of the same
  size. Additional octet array objects are appended to the sequence to
  accommodate changes in the size of the octet sequence.

* A sequence of one or more octet arrays of varying sizes. Additional octet
  array objects are appended to the sequence to accommodate changes in the
  size of the character sequence. This is the implementation approach
  currently offered by [link beast.ref.basic_streambuf `basic_streambuf`].

In the table below:

* `X` denotes a dynamic buffer class.
* `a` denotes a value of type `X`.
* `c` denotes a (possibly const) value of type `X`.
* `n` denotes a value of type `std::size_t`.
* `T` denotes a type meeting the requirements for [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/ConstBufferSequence.html `ConstBufferSequence`].
* `U` denotes a type meeting the requirements for [@http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/MutableBufferSequence.html `MutableBufferSequence`].

    [
        Appends `n` bytes from the start of the output sequence to the end of
        the input sequence. The remainder of the output sequence is discarded.
        If `n` is greater than the size of the output sequence, the entire
        output sequence is appended to the input sequence. All constant or
