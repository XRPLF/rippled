/** Hook for performing activity on program exit.

    These hooks execute when objects with static storage duration are
    destroyed. The hooks are called in the reverse order that they were
    created.

    To use, derive your class from AtExitHook and implement onExit.
    Alternatively, add AtExitMemberHook as a data member of your class and
    then provide your own onExit function with this signature:

    @code

    void onExit ()

    @endcode

    @see AtExitMemberHook

class AtExitHook
{
protected:
    AtExitHook ();
    virtual ~AtExitHook ();

    /** Called at program exit. */
    virtual void onExit () = 0;

private:
    class Manager;

    class Item : public List <Item>::Node
    {
    public:
        explicit Item (AtExitHook* hook);
        AtExitHook* hook ();

    private:
        AtExitHook* m_hook;
    };

    Item m_item;
