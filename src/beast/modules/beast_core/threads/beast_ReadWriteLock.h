/**
    A critical section that allows multiple simultaneous readers.

    Features of this type of lock are:

    - Multiple readers can hold the lock at the same time, but only one writer
      can hold it at once.
    - Writers trying to gain the lock will be blocked until all readers and writers
      have released it
    - Readers trying to gain the lock while a writer is waiting to acquire it will be
      blocked until the writer has obtained and released it
    - If a thread already has a read lock and tries to obtain a write lock, it will succeed if
      there are no other readers
    - If a thread already has the write lock and tries to obtain a read lock, this will succeed.
    - Recursive locking is supported.
