/**
    A high-resolution periodic timer.

    This provides accurately-timed regular callbacks. Unlike the normal Timer
    class, this one uses a dedicated thread, not the message thread, so is
    far more stable and precise.

    You should only use this class in situations where you really need accuracy,
    because unlike the normal Timer class, which is very lightweight and cheap
    to start/stop, the HighResolutionTimer will use far more resources, and
    starting/stopping it may involve launching and killing threads.
