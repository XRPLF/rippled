// This is a hack to fix boost's goofy placeholders going into the global
// namespace. First we prevent the user from including boost/bind.hpp
// before us. Then we define the include guard macro and include
// boost/bind.hpp ourselves to get the declarations. Finally we repeat
// the missing placeholder declarations but put them in a proper namespace.
//
// We put the placeholders in boost::placeholders so they can be accessed
// explicitly to handle the common case of a "using namespace oost" directive
// being in effect.
//
// Declarations based on boost/bind/placeholders.cpp
