/** Provides random access reading and writing to an operating system file.

    This class wraps the underlying native operating system routines for
    opening and closing a file for reading and/or writing, seeking within
    the file, and performing read and write operations. There are also methods
    provided for obtaining an input or output stream which will work with
    the file.

    @note All files are opened in binary mode. No text newline conversions
          are performed.

    @note None of these members are thread safe. The caller is responsible
          for synchronization.
