/**
    Encapsulates the logic required to implement a lock-free FIFO.

    This class handles the logic needed when building a single-reader,
    single-writer FIFO.

    It doesn't actually hold any data itself, but your FIFO class can use one of
    these to manage its position and status when reading or writing to it.

    To use it, you can call prepareToWrite() to determine the position within
    your own buffer that an incoming block of data should be stored, and
    prepareToRead() to find out when the next outgoing block should be read from.

    e.g.
    @code
    class MyFifo
    {
    public:
        MyFifo()  : abstractFifo (1024)
        {
        }

        void addToFifo (const int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            abstractFifo.prepareToWrite (numItems, start1, size1, start2, size2);

            if (size1 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start1, someData, size1);

            if (size2 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start2, someData + size1, size2);

            abstractFifo.finishedWrite (size1 + size2);
        }

        void readFromFifo (int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            abstractFifo.prepareToRead (numSamples, start1, size1, start2, size2);

            if (size1 > 0)
                copySomeData (someData, myBuffer + start1, size1);

            if (size2 > 0)
                copySomeData (someData + size1, myBuffer + start2, size2);

            abstractFifo.finishedRead (size1 + size2);
        }

    private:
        AbstractFifo abstractFifo;
        int myBuffer [1024];
    };
    @endcode

    /** Returns the location within the buffer at which an incoming block of data should be written.

        Because the section of data that you want to add to the buffer may overlap the end
        and wrap around to the start, two blocks within your buffer are returned, and you
        should copy your data into the first one, with any remaining data spilling over into
        the second.

        If the number of items you ask for is too large to fit within the buffer's free space, then
        blockSize1 + blockSize2 may add up to a lower value than numToWrite. If this happens, you
        may decide to keep waiting and re-trying the method until there's enough space available.

        After calling this method, if you choose to write your data into the blocks returned, you
        must call finishedWrite() to tell the FIFO how much data you actually added.

        e.g.
        @code
        void addToFifo (const int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            prepareToWrite (numItems, start1, size1, start2, size2);

            if (size1 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start1, someData, size1);

            if (size2 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start2, someData + size1, size2);

            finishedWrite (size1 + size2);
        }
        @endcode

        @param numToWrite       indicates how many items you'd like to add to the buffer
        @param startIndex1      on exit, this will contain the start index in your buffer at which your data should be written
        @param blockSize1       on exit, this indicates how many items can be written to the block starting at startIndex1
        @param startIndex2      on exit, this will contain the start index in your buffer at which any data that didn't fit into
                                the first block should be written
        @param blockSize2       on exit, this indicates how many items can be written to the block starting at startIndex2
        @see finishedWrite
    */
    void prepareToWrite (int numToWrite, int& startIndex1, int& blockSize1, int& startIndex2, int& blockSize2) const noexcept;

    /** Called after writing from the FIFO, to indicate that this many items have been added.
        @see prepareToWrite
    */
    void finishedWrite (int numWritten) noexcept;

    /** Returns the location within the buffer from which the next block of data should be read.

        Because the section of data that you want to read from the buffer may overlap the end
        and wrap around to the start, two blocks within your buffer are returned, and you
        should read from both of them.

        If the number of items you ask for is greater than the amount of data available, then
        blockSize1 + blockSize2 may add up to a lower value than numWanted. If this happens, you
        may decide to keep waiting and re-trying the method until there's enough data available.

        After calling this method, if you choose to read the data, you must call finishedRead() to
        tell the FIFO how much data you have consumed.

        e.g.
        @code
        void readFromFifo (int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            prepareToRead (numSamples, start1, size1, start2, size2);

        @param startIndex2      on exit, this will contain the start index in your buffer at which any data that didn't fit into
                                the first block should be written
        @param blockSize2       on exit, this indicates how many items can be written to the block starting at startIndex2
        @see finishedRead
    */
    void prepareToRead (int numWanted, int& startIndex1, int& blockSize1, int& startIndex2, int& blockSize2) const noexcept;
