/** Signal a fatal error.

    A fatal error indicates that the program has encountered an unexpected
    situation and cannot continue safely. Reasons for raising a fatal error
    would be to protect data integrity, prevent valuable resources from being
    wasted, or to ensure that the user does not experience undefined behavior.

    This function will end the process with exit code EXIT_FAILURE. Before
    the process is terminated, a listener object gets notified so that the
    client application can perform logging or emit further diagnostics.

        /** Called when a fatal error is raised.

            Because the program is likely in an inconsistent state, it is a
            good idea to do as little as possible from within this function.
            It will be called from the thread that raised the fatal error.

            The default implementation of this function first calls
            formatMessage to produce the string, then calls reportMessage
            to report the results.

            You can override this to perform custom formatting.

            @note filePath may be a zero length string if identifying
                  information was stripped from the executable for security.

            @note stackBacktrace will be a string with zero characters for
                  platforms for which which don't support stack crawls, or
                  when symbolic information is missing from the executable.

            @param message The error message.
            @param stackBackTrace The stack of the thread that raised the error.
            @param filePath A full or partial path to the source file that raised the error.
            @param lineNumber The line number in the source file.

        the base class version of Reporter::onFatalError.
