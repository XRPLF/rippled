/**
    A class for dynamically evaluating simple numeric expressions.

    This class can parse a simple C-style string expression involving floating point
    numbers, named symbols and functions. The basic arithmetic operations of +, -, *, /
    are supported, as well as parentheses, and any alphanumeric identifiers are
    assumed to be named symbols which will be resolved when the expression is
    evaluated.

    Expressions which use identifiers and functions require a subclass of
    Expression::Scope to be supplied when evaluating them, and this object
    is expected to be able to resolve the symbol names and perform the functions that
    are used.
