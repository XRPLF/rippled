/**
    This class acts as a pointer which will automatically become null if the object
    to which it points is deleted.

    To accomplish this, the source object needs to cooperate by performing a couple of simple tasks.
    It must embed a WeakReference::Master object, which stores a shared pointer object, and must clear
    this master pointer in its destructor.

    E.g.
    @code
    class MyObject
    {
    public:
        MyObject()
        {
            // If you're planning on using your WeakReferences in a multi-threaded situation, you may choose
            // to create a WeakReference to the object here in the constructor, which will pre-initialise the
            // embedded object, avoiding an (extremely unlikely) race condition that could occur if multiple
            // threads overlap while creating the first WeakReference to it.
        }

        ~MyObject()
        {
            // This will zero all the references - you need to call this in your destructor.
            masterReference.clear();
        }

    private:
        // You need to embed a variable of this type, with the name "masterReference" inside your object. If the
        // variable is not public, you should make your class a friend of WeakReference<MyObject> so that the
        // WeakReference class can access it.
        WeakReference<MyObject>::Master masterReference;
        friend class WeakReference<MyObject>;
    };

    // Here's an example of using a pointer..

    MyObject* n = new MyObject();
    WeakReference<MyObject> myObjectRef = n;

    MyObject* pointer1 = myObjectRef;  // returns a valid pointer to 'n'
    delete n;
    MyObject* pointer2 = myObjectRef;  // returns a null pointer
    @endcode
