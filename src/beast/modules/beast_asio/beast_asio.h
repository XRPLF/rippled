/*  If you fail to make sure that all your compile units are building Beast with
    the same set of option flags, then there's a risk that different compile
    units will treat the classes as having different memory layouts, leading to
    very nasty memory corruption errors when they all get linked together.
    That's why it's best to always include the BeastConfig.h file before any
    beast headers.
