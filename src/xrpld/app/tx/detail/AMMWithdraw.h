/** AMMWithdraw implements AMM withdraw Transactor.
 * The withdraw transaction is used to remove liquidity from the AMM instance
 * pool, thus redeeming some share of the pools that one owns in the form
 * of LPTokens. If the trader withdraws proportional values of both assets
 * without changing their relative pricing, no trading fee is charged on
 * the transaction. The trader can specify different combination of
 * the fields in the withdrawal.
 * LPTokens - transaction assumes proportional withdrawal of pool assets
 *     for the amount of LPTokens.
 * Asset1Out - transaction assumes withdrawal of single asset equivalent
 *     to the amount specified in Asset1Out.
 * Asset1Out and Asset2Out - transaction assumes all assets withdrawal
 *     with the constraints on the maximum amount of each asset that
 *     the trader is willing to withdraw.
 * Asset1Out and LPTokens - transaction assumes withdrawal of single
 *     asset specified in Asset1Out proportional to the share represented
 *     by the amount of LPTokens.
 * Asset1Out and EPrice - transaction assumes withdrawal of single
 *     asset with the following constraints:
 *         a. Amount of asset1 if specified (not 0) in Asset1Out specifies
 *             the minimum amount of asset1 that the trader is willing
 *             to withdraw.
 *         b. The effective price of asset traded out does not exceed
 *             the amount specified in EPrice.
 * Following updates after a successful transaction:
 * The withdrawn asset, if XRP, is transferred from AMM instance account
 *     to the account that initiated the transaction, thus changing
 *     the Balance field of each account.
 * The withdrawn asset, if token, is balanced between the AMM instance
 *     account and the issuer account.
 * The LPTokens ~  are balanced between the AMM instance account and
 *     the account that initiated the transaction.
 * The pool composition is updated.
 * @see [XLS30d:AMMWithdraw
 * transaction](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions/78)
