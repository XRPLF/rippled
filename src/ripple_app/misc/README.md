# Features

A feature is a proposed change or functionality to the ripple system. This can 
be almost anything but it must be accepted by a network majority through a 
consensus process before it is utilized. A feature must receive at least an 80% 
approval rate from validating nodes for a period of two weeks before being 
accepted. The following example outlines the process of a feature from its 
conception to approval and usage. 

*	A community member makes a proposal to change transaction processing in some 
  way. The proposal is discussed amongst the community and receives its support 
  creating a community or human consensus. 

*	Some members contribute their time and work to develop the feature.

*	A pull request is created and the new code is folded into a rippled build 
  and made available for use.

*	The consensus process begins with the validating nodes.

*	If the feature holds an 80% majority for a two week period, nodes will begin 
  including the transaction to enable it in their initial sets.

Nodes may veto features they consider undesirable by never announcing their 
support for those features. Just a few nodes vetoing a feature will normally 
keep it from being accepted. Nodes could also vote yes on a feature even before 
it obtains a super-majority. This might make sense for a critical bugfix.
