/*
    An RPC command is received and is handled via ServerHandler(HTTP) or
    Handler(websocket), depending on the connection type. The handler then calls
    the JobQueue::postCoro() method to create a coroutine and run it at a later
    point. This frees up the handler thread and allows it to continue handling
    other requests while the RPC command completes its work asynchronously.

    postCoro() creates a Coro object. When the Coro ctor is called, and its
    coro_ member is initialized (a boost::coroutines::pull_type), execution
    automatically passes to the coroutine, which we don't want at this point,
    since we are still in the handler thread context. It's important to note
   here that construction of a boost pull_type automatically passes execution to
   the coroutine. A pull_type object automatically generates a push_type that is
    passed as a parameter (do_yield) in the signature of the function the
    pull_type was created with. This function is immediately called during coro_
    construction and within it, Coro::yield_ is assigned the push_type
    parameter (do_yield) address and called (yield()) so we can return execution
    back to the caller's stack.

    postCoro() then calls Coro::post(), which schedules a job on the job
    queue to continue execution of the coroutine in a JobQueue worker thread at
    some later time. When the job runs, we lock on the Coro::mutex_ and call
    coro_ which continues where we had left off. Since we the last thing we did
    in coro_ was call yield(), the next thing we continue with is calling the
    function param f, that was passed into Coro ctor. It is within this
    function body that the caller specifies what he would like to do while
    running in the coroutine and allow them to suspend and resume execution.
    A task that relies on other events to complete, such as path finding, calls
    Coro::yield() to suspend its execution while waiting on those events to
    complete and continue when signaled via the Coro::post() method.

    There is a potential race condition that exists here where post() can get
    called before yield() after f is called. Technically the problem only occurs
    if the job that post() scheduled is executed before yield() is called.
    If the post() job were to be executed before yield(), undefined behavior
    would occur. The lock ensures that coro_ is not called again until we exit
    the coroutine. At which point a scheduled resume() job waiting on the lock
    would gain entry, harmlessly call coro_ and immediately return as we have
    already completed the coroutine.

    The race condition occurs as follows:

        1- The coroutine is running.
        2- The coroutine is about to suspend, but before it can do so, it must
            arrange for some event to wake it up.
        3- The coroutine arranges for some event to wake it up.
        4- Before the coroutine can suspend, that event occurs and the
   resumption of the coroutine is scheduled on the job queue. 5- Again, before
   the coroutine can suspend, the resumption of the coroutine is dispatched. 6-
   Again, before the coroutine can suspend, the resumption code runs the
            coroutine.
        The coroutine is now running in two threads.

        The lock prevents this from happening as step 6 will block until the
            lock is released which only happens after the coroutine completes.
