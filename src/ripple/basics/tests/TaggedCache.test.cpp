I guess you can put some items in, make sure they're still there. Let some
time pass, make sure they're gone. Keep a strong pointer to one of them, make
sure you can still find it even after time passes. Create two objects with
the same key, canonicalize them both and make sure you get the same object.
Put an object in but keep a strong pointer to it, advance the clock a lot,
then canonicalize a new object with the same key, make sure you get the
original object.
