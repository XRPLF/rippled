    Hashes are used to uniquely identify objects like

    For historical reasons, some hashes are 256 bits and some are 160.

    David:
        "The theory is that you may need to communicate public keys
         to others, so having them be shorter is a good idea. plus,
         you can't arbitrarily tweak them because you wouldn't know
         the corresponding private key anyway. So the security
         requirements aren't as great."
