# Fees

Rippled's fee mechanism consists of several interrelated processes:

1. [Rapid Fee escalation](#fee-escalation)
2. [The Transaction Queue](#transaction-queue)

## Fee Escalation

The guiding principal of fee escalation is that when things are going
smoothly, fees stay low, but as soon as high levels of traffic appear
on the network, fees will grow quickly to extreme levels. This should
dissuade malicious users from abusing the system, while giving
legitimate users the ability to pay a higher fee to get high-priority
transactions into the open ledger, even during unfavorable conditions.

How fees escalate:

1. There is a base [fee level](#fee-level) of 256,
which is the minimum that a typical transaction
is required to pay. For a [reference
transaction](#reference-transaction), that corresponds to the
network base fee, which is currently 10 drops.
2. However, there is a limit on the number of transactions that
can get into an open ledger for that base fee level. The limit
will vary based on the [health](#consensus-health) of the
consensus process, but will be at least [5](#other-constants).
  * If consensus stays [healthy](#consensus-health), the limit will
  be the max of the current limit or the number of transactions in
  the validated ledger until it gets to [50](#other-constants), at
  which point, the limit will be the largest number of transactions
  in the last [20](#other-constants) validated ledgers which had
  more than 50 transactions. Any time the limit decreases (ie. a
  large ledger is no longer recent), the limit will decrease to the
  new largest value by 10% each time the ledger has more than 50
  transactions.
  * If consensus does not stay [healthy](#consensus-health),
  the limit will clamp down to the smaller of [50](#other-constants)
  or the number of transactions in the validated ledger.
3. Once there are more transactions in the open ledger than indicated
by the limit, the required fee level jumps drastically.
  * The formula is `( lastLedgerMedianFeeLevel *
  TransactionsInOpenLedger^2 / limit^2 )`,
  and returns a [fee level](#fee-level).
4. That may still be pretty small, but as more transactions get
into the ledger, the fee level increases exponentially.
  * For example, if the limit is 6, and the median fee is minimal,
  and assuming all [reference transactions](#reference-transaction),
  the 8th transaction only requires a [level](#fee-level) of about 174,000
  or about 6800 drops,
  but the 20th transaction requires a [level](#fee-level) of about
  1,283,000 or about 50,000 drops.
5. Finally, as each ledger closes, the median fee level of that ledger is
computed and used as `lastLedgerMedianFeeLevel` (with a
[minimum value of 128,000](#other-constants))
in the fee escalation formula for the next open ledger.
  * Continuing the example above, if ledger consensus completes with
  only those 20 transactions, and all of those transactions paid the
  minimum required fee at each step, the limit will be adjusted from
  6 to 20, and the `lastLedgerMedianFeeLevel` will be about 322,000,
  which is 12,600 drops for a
  [reference transaction](#reference-transaction).
  * This will cause the first 21 transactions only require 10
  drops, but the 22nd transaction will require
  a level of about 355,000 or about 13,800 drops.

* This example assumes a cold-start scenario, with a single, possibly
malicious, user willing to pay arbitrary amounts to get transactions
into the open ledger. It ignores the effects of the [Transaction
Queue](#transaction-queue). Any lower fee level transactions submitted
by other users at the same time as this user's transactions will go into
the transaction queue, and will have the first opportunity to be applied
to the _next_ open ledger. The next section describes how that works in
more detail.

## Transaction Queue

An integral part of making fee escalation work for users of the network
is the transaction queue. The queue allows legitimate transactions to be
considered by the network for future ledgers if the escalated open
ledger fee gets too high. This allows users to submit low priority
transactions with a low fee, and wait for high fees to drop. It also
allows legitimate users to continue submitting transactions during high
traffic periods, and give those transactions a much better chance to
succeed.

1. If an incoming transaction meets both the base [fee
level](#fee-level) and the load fee minimum, but does not have a high
enough [fee level](#fee-level) to immediately go into the open ledger,
it is instead put into the queue and broadcast to peers. Each peer will
then make an independent decision about whether to put the transaction
into its open ledger or the queue. In principle, peers with identical
open ledgers will come to identical decisions. Any discrepancies will be
resolved as usual during consensus.
2. When consensus completes, the open ledger limit is adjusted, and
the required [fee level](#fee-level) drops back to the base
[fee level](#fee-level). Before the ledger is made available to
external transactions, transactions are applied from the queue to the
ledger from highest [fee level](#fee-level) to lowest. These transactions
count against the open ledger limit, so the required [fee level](#fee-level)
may start rising during this process.
3. Once the queue is empty, or required the [fee level](#fee-level)
jumps too high for the remaining transactions in the queue, the ledger
is opened up for normal transaction processing.
4. A transaction in the queue can stay there indefinitely in principle,
but in practice, either
  * it will eventually get applied to the ledger,
  * it will attempt to apply to the ledger and fail,
  * it will attempt to apply to the ledger and retry [10
  times](#other-constants),
  * its last ledger sequence number will expire,
  * the user will replace it by submitting another transaction with the same
  sequence number and at least a [25% higher fee](#other-constants), or
  * it will get dropped when the queue fills up with more valuable transactions.
  The size limit is computed dynamically, and can hold transactions for
  the next [20 ledgers](#other-constants) (restricted to a minimum of
  [2000 transactions](#other-constants)). The lower the transaction's
  fee, the more likely that it will get dropped if the network is busy.

If a transaction is submitted for an account with one or more transactions
already in the queue, and a sequence number that is sequential with the other
transactions in the queue for that account, it will be considered
for the queue if it meets these additional criteria:
  * the account has fewer than [10](#other-constants) transactions
  already in the queue.
  * it pays a [fee level](#fee-level) that is greater than 10% of the
  fee level for the transaction with the previous sequence number,
  * all other queued transactions for that account, in the case where
  they spend the maximum possible XRP, leave enough XRP balance to pay
  the fee,
  * the total fees for the other queued transactions are less than both
  the network's minimum reserve and the account's XRP balance, and
  * none of the prior queued transactions affect the ability of subsequent
  transactions to claim a fee.

Currently, there is an additional restriction that the queue can not work with
transactions using the `sfPreviousTxnID` or `sfAccountTxnID` fields.
`sfPreviousTxnID` is deprecated and shouldn't be used anyway. Future
development will make the queue aware of `sfAccountTxnID` mechanisms.

## Technical Details

### Fee Level

"Fee level" is used to allow the cost of different types of transactions
to be compared directly.  For a [reference
transaction](#reference-transaction), the base fee
level is 256. If a transaction is submitted with a higher `Fee` field,
the fee level is scaled appropriately.

Examples, assuming a [reference transaction](#reference-transaction)
base fee of 10 drops:

1. A single-signed [reference transaction](#reference-transaction)
with `Fee=20` will have a fee level of
`20 drop fee * 256 fee level / 10 drop base fee = 512 fee level`.
2. A multi-signed [reference transaction](#reference-transaction) with
3 signatures (base fee = 40 drops) and `Fee=60` will have a fee level of
`60 drop fee * 256 fee level / ((1tx + 3sigs) * 10 drop base fee) = 384
fee level`.
3. A hypothetical future non-reference transaction with a base
fee of 15 drops multi-signed with 5 signatures and `Fee=90` will
have a fee level of
`90 drop fee * 256 fee level / ((1tx + 5sigs) * 15 drop base fee) = 256
fee level`.

This demonstrates that a simpler transaction paying less XRP can be more
likely to get into the open ledger, or be sorted earlier in the queue
than a more complex transaction paying more XRP.

### Reference Transaction

In this document, a "Reference Transaction" is any currently implemented
single-signed transaction (eg. Payment, Account Set, Offer Create, etc)
that requires a fee.

In the future, there may be other transaction types that require
more (or less) work for rippled to process. Those transactions may have
a higher (or lower) base fee, requiring a correspondingly higher (or
lower) fee to get into the same position as a reference transaction.

### Consensus Health

For consensus to be considered healthy, the consensus process must take
less than 5 seconds. This time limit was chosen based on observed past
behavior of the ripple network. Note that this is not necessarily the
time between ledger closings, as consensus usually starts some amount
of time after a ledger opens.

### Other Constants

* *Base fee transaction limit per ledger*. The minimum value of 5 was
chosen to ensure the limit never gets so small that the ledger becomes
unusable. The "target" value of 50 was chosen so the limit never gets large
enough to invite abuse, but keeps up if the network stays healthy and
active. These exact values were chosen experimentally, and can easily
change in the future.
* *Minimum `lastLedgerMedianFeeLevel`*. The value of 500 was chosen to
ensure that the first escalated fee was more significant and noticable
than what the default would allow. This exact value was chosen
experimentally, and can easily change in the future.
* *Transaction queue size limit*. The limit is computed based on the
base fee transaction limit per ledger, so that the queue can grow
automatically as the ripple network's performance improves, allowing
more transactions per second, and thus more transactions per ledger
to process successfully.  The limit of 20 ledgers was used to provide
a balance between resource (specifically memory) usage, and giving
transactions a realistic chance to be processed. The minimum size of
2000 transactions was chosen to allow a decent functional backlog during
network congestion conditions. These exact values were
chosen experimentally, and can easily change in the future.
* *Maximum retries*. A transaction in the queue can attempt to apply
to the open ledger, but get a retry (`ter`) code up to 10 times, at
which point, it will be removed from the queue and dropped. The
value was chosen to be large enough to allow temporary failures to clear
up, but small enough that the queue doesn't fill up with stale
transactions which prevent lower fee level, but more likely to succeed,
transactions from queuing.
* *Maximum transactions per account*. A single account can have up to 10
transactions in the queue at any given time. This is primarily to
mitigate the lost cost of broadcasting multiple transactions if one of
the earlier ones fails or is otherwise removed from the queue without
being applied to the open ledger. The value was chosen arbitrarily, and
can easily change in the future.
* *Minimum last ledger sequence buffer*. If a transaction has a
`LastLedgerSequence` value, and can not be processed into the open
ledger, that `LastLedgerSequence` must be at least 2 more than the
sequence number of the open ledger to be considered for the queue. The
value was chosen to provide a balance between letting the user control
the lifespan of the transaction, and giving a queued transaction a
chance to get processed out of the queue before getting discarded,
particularly since it may have dependent transactions also in the queue,
which will never succeed if this one is discarded.
* *Replaced transaction fee increase*. Any transaction in the queue can be
replaced by another transaction with the same sequence number and at
least a 25% higher fee level. The 25% increase is intended to cover the
resource cost incurred by broadcasting the original transaction to the
network. This value was chosen experimentally, and can easily change in
the future.

### `fee` command

**The `fee` RPC and WebSocket command is still experimental, and may
change without warning.**

`fee` takes no parameters, and returns information about the current local
[fee escalation](#fee-escalation) and [transaction queue](#transaction-queue)
state as both fee levels and drops. The drop values assume a
single-singed reference transaction. It is up to the user to compute the
neccessary fees for other types of transactions. (E.g. multiply all drop
values by 5 for a multi-signed transaction with 4 signatures.)

The `fee` result is always instantanteous, and relates to the open
ledger. Thus, it does not include any sequence number or IDs, and may
not make sense if rippled is not synced to the network.

Result format:
```
{
   "result" : {
      "current_ledger_size" : "16", // number of transactions in the open ledger
      "current_queue_size" : "2", // number of transactions waiting in the queue
      "expected_ledger_size" : "15", // one less than the number of transactions that can get into the open ledger for the base fee.
      "max_queue_size" : "300", // number of transactions allowed into the queue
      "levels" : {
         "reference_level" : "256", // level of a reference transaction. Always 256.
         "minimum_level" : "256", // minimum fee level to get into the queue. If >256, indicates the queue is full.
         "median_level" : "281600", // lastLedgerMedianFeeLevel used in escalation calculations.
         "open_ledger_level" : "320398" // minimum fee level to get into the open ledger immediately.
      },
      "drops" : {
         "base_fee" : "10", // base fee of a reference transaction in drops.
         "minimum_fee" : "10", // minimum drops to get a reference transaction into the queue. If >base_fee, indicates the queue is full.
         "median_fee" : "11000", // drop equivalent of "median_level" for a reference transaction.
         "open_ledger_fee" : "12516" // minimum drops to get a reference transaction into the open ledger immediately.
      }
   }
}
```

### [`server_info`](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#server-info) command

**The fields listed here are still experimental, and may change
without warning.**

Up to two fields in `server_info` output are related to fee escalation.

1. `load_factor_fee_escalation`: The factor on base transaction cost
that a transaction must pay to get into the open ledger. This value can
change quickly as transactions are processed from the network and
ledgers are closed. If not escalated, the value is 1, so will not be
returned.
2. `load_factor_fee_queue`: If the queue is full, this is the factor on
base transaction cost that a transaction must pay to get into the queue.
If not full, the value is 1, so will not be returned.

In all cases, the transaction fee must be high enough to overcome both
`load_factor_fee_queue` and `load_factor` to be considered. It does not
need to overcome `load_factor_fee_escalation`, though if it does not, it
is more likely to be queued than immediately processed into the open
ledger.

### [`server_state`](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#server-state) command

**The fields listed here are still experimental, and may change
without warning.**

Three fields in `server_state` output are related to fee escalation.

1. `load_factor_fee_escalation`: The factor on base transaction cost
that a transaction must pay to get into the open ledger. This value can
change quickly as transactions are processed from the network and
ledgers are closed. The ratio between this value and
`load_factor_fee_reference` determines the multiplier for transaction
fees to get into the current open ledger.
2. `load_factor_fee_queue`: This is the factor on base transaction cost
that a transaction must pay to get into the queue. The ratio between
this value and `load_factor_fee_reference` determines the multiplier for
transaction fees to get into the transaction queue to be considered for
a later ledger.
3. `load_factor_fee_reference`: Like `load_base`, this is the baseline
that is used to scale fee escalation computations.

In all cases, the transaction fee must be high enough to overcome both
`load_factor_fee_queue` and `load_factor` to be considered. It does not
need to overcome `load_factor_fee_escalation`, though if it does not, it
is more likely to be queued than immediately processed into the open
ledger.
