    Validator key manifests
    -----------------------

    Suppose the secret keys installed on a Ripple validator are compromised. Not
    only do you have to generate and install new key pairs on each validator,
    EVERY rippled needs to have its config updated with the new public keys, and
    is vulnerable to forged validation signatures until this is done.  The
    solution is a new layer of indirection: A master secret key under
    restrictive access control is used to sign a "manifest": essentially, a
    certificate including the master public key, an ephemeral public key for
    verifying validations (which will be signed by its secret counterpart), a
    sequence number, and a digital signature.

    The manifest has two serialized forms: one which includes the digital
    signature and one which doesn't.  There is an obvious causal dependency
    relationship between the (latter) form with no signature, the signature
    of that form, and the (former) form which includes that signature.  In
    other words, a message can't contain a signature of itself.  The code
    below stores a serialized manifest which includes the signature, and
    dynamically generates the signatureless form when it needs to verify
    the signature.

    An instance of ManifestCache stores, for each trusted validator, (a) its
    master public key, and (b) the most senior of all valid manifests it has
    seen for that validator, if any.  On startup, the [validator_token] config
    entry (which contains the manifest for this validator) is decoded and
    added to the manifest cache.  Other manifests are added as "gossip"
    received from rippled peers.

    When an ephemeral key is compromised, a new signing key pair is created,
    along with a new manifest vouching for it (with a higher sequence number),
    signed by the master key.  When a rippled peer receives the new manifest,
    it verifies it with the master key and (assuming it's valid) discards the
    old ephemeral key and stores the new one.  If the master key itself gets
    compromised, a manifest with sequence number 0xFFFFFFFF will supersede a
    prior manifest and discard any existing ephemeral key without storing a
    new one.  These revocation manifests are loaded from the
    [validator_key_revocation] config entry as well as received as gossip from
    peers.  Since no further manifests for this master key will be accepted
    (since no higher sequence number is possible), and no signing key is on
    record, no validations will be accepted from the compromised validator.
