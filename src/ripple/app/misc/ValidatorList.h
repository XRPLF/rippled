/**
    Trusted Validators List
    -----------------------

    Rippled accepts ledger proposals and validations from trusted validator
    nodes. A ledger is considered fully-validated once the number of received
    trusted validations for a ledger meets or exceeds a quorum value.

    This class manages the set of validation public keys the local rippled node
    trusts. The list of trusted keys is populated using the keys listed in the
    configuration file as well as lists signed by trusted publishers. The
    trusted publisher public keys are specified in the config.

    New lists are expected to include the following data:

    @li @c "blob": Base64-encoded JSON string containing a @c "sequence", @c
        "expiration", and @c "validators" field. @c "expiration" contains the
        Ripple timestamp (seconds since January 1st, 2000 (00:00 UTC)) for when
        the list expires. @c "validators" contains an array of objects with a
        @c "validation_public_key" and optional @c "manifest" field.
        @c "validation_public_key" should be the hex-encoded master public key.
        @c "manifest" should be the base64-encoded validator manifest.

    @li @c "manifest": Base64-encoded serialization of a manifest containing the
        publisher's master and signing public keys.

    @li @c "signature": Hex-encoded signature of the blob using the publisher's
        signing key.

    @li @c "version": 1

    Individual validator lists are stored separately by publisher. The number of
    lists on which a validator's public key appears is also tracked.

    The list of trusted validation public keys is reset at the start of each
    consensus round to take into account the latest known lists as well as the
    set of validators from whom validations are being received. Listed
    validation public keys are shuffled and then sorted by the number of lists
    they appear on. (The shuffling makes the order/rank of validators with the
    same number of listings non-deterministic.) A quorum value is calculated for
    the new trusted validator list. If there is only one list, all listed keys
    are trusted. Otherwise, the trusted list size is set to 125% of the quorum.
