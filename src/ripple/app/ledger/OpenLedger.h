        Thread safety:

        Effects:

            A new open view based on the accepted ledger
            is created, and the list of retriable
            transactions is optionally applied first
            depending on the value of `retriesFirst`.

            The transactions in the current open view
            are applied to the new open view.

            The list of local transactions are applied
            to the new open view.

            The optional modify function f is called
            to perform further modifications to the
            open view, atomically. Changes made in
            the modify function are not visible to
            callers until accept() returns.

            Any failed, retriable transactions are left
            in `retries` for the caller.

            The current view is atomically set to the
            new open view.
