/* VFALCO TODO digest this terminology clarification:
    Closed and accepted refer to ledgers that have not passed the
    validation threshold yet. Once they pass the threshold, they are
    "Validated". Closed just means its close time has passed and no
    new transactions can get in. "Accepted" means we believe it to be
    the result of the a consensus process (though haven't validated
    it yet).
