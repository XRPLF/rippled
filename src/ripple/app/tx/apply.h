        Transactor will attempt to only charge a fee,
        and return tecFAILED_PROCESSING.

        If the Transactor gets an exception while trying
        to charge the fee, it will be caught here and
        turned into tefEXCEPTION.

        This try/catch handler is the last resort, any
        uncaught exceptions will be turned into
        tefEXCEPTION.

        best effort to at least charge a fee if the
        ledger is closed.
