/** Presents and consumes the offers in an order book.

    Two `LedgerView` objects accumulate changes to the ledger. `view`
    is applied when the calling transaction succeeds. If the calling
    transaction fails, then `view_cancel` is applied.

    Certain invalid offers are automatically removed:
        - Offers with missing ledger entries
        - Offers that expired
        - Offers found unfunded:
            An offer is found unfunded when the corresponding balance is zero
            and the caller has not modified the balance. This is accomplished
            by also looking up the balance in the cancel view.

    When an offer is removed, it is removed from both views. This grooms the
    order book regardless of whether or not the transaction is successful.
