        Conceptually, the quality is the ratio of output to input currency.
        The implementation calculates it as the ratio of input to output
        currency (so it sorts ascending). The quality is computed at the time
        the offer is placed, and never changes for the lifetime of the offer.
        This is an important business rule that maintains accuracy when an
        offer is partially filled; Subsequent partial fills will use the
        original quality.
