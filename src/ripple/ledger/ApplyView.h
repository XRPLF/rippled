/** Writeable view to a ledger, for applying a transaction.

    This refinement of ReadView provides an interface where
    the SLE can be "checked out" for modifications and put
    back in an updated or removed state. Also added is an
    interface to provide contextual information necessary
    to calculate the results of transaction processing,
    including the metadata if the view is later applied to
    the parent (using an interface in the derived class).
    The context info also includes values from the base
    ledger such as sequence number and the network time.

    This allows implementations to journal changes made to
    the state items in a ledger, with the option to apply
    those changes to the base or discard the changes without
    affecting the base.

    Typical usage is to call read() for non-mutating
    operations.

    For mutating operations the sequence is as follows:

        // Add a new value
        v.insert(sle);

        // Check out a value for modification
        sle = v.peek(k);

        // Indicate that changes were made
        v.update(sle)

        // Or, erase the value
        v.erase(sle)

    The invariant is that insert, update, and erase may not
    be called with any SLE which belongs to different view.
