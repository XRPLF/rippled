/** Represents a proposed position taken during a round of consensus.

    During consensus, peers seek agreement on a set of transactions to
    apply to the prior ledger to generate the next ledger.  Each peer takes a
    position on whether to include or exclude potential transactions.
    The position on the set of transactions is proposed to its peers as an
    instance of the ConsensusProposal class.

    An instance of ConsensusProposal can be either our own proposal or one of
    our peer's.

    As consensus proceeds, peers may change their position on the transaction,
    or choose to abstain. Each successive proposal includes a strictly
    monotonically increasing number (or, if a peer is choosing to abstain,
    the special value `seqLeave`).

    Refer to @ref Consensus for requirements of the template arguments.

    @tparam NodeID_t Type used to uniquely identify nodes/peers
    @tparam LedgerID_t Type used to uniquely identify ledgers
    @tparam Position_t Type used to represent the position taken on transactions
                       under consideration during this round of consensus
