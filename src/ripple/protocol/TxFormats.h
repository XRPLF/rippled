/** Transaction type identifiers.

/** Transaction type identifieers

    Each ledger object requires a unique type identifier, which is stored
    within the object itself; this makes it possible to iterate the entire
    ledger and determine each object's type and verify that the object you
    retrieved from a given hash matches the expected type.

    @warning Since these values are included in transactions, which are signed
             objects, and used by the code to determine the type of transaction
             being invoked, they are part of the protocol. **Changing them
             should be avoided because without special handling, this will
             result in a hard fork.**

    @note When retiring types, the specific values should not be removed but
          should be marked as [[deprecated]]. This is to avoid accidental
          reuse of identifiers.

    @todo The C++ language does not enable checking for duplicate values
          here. If it becomes possible then we should do this.
