// Questions regarding buildMultiSigningData:
//
// Why do we include the Signer.Account in the blob to be signed?
//
// Unless you include the Account which is signing in the signing blob,
// you could swap out any Signer.Account for any other, which may also
// be on the SignerList and have a RegularKey matching the
// Signer.SigningPubKey.
//
// That RegularKey may be set to allow some 3rd party to sign transactions
// on the account's behalf, and that RegularKey could be common amongst all
// users of the 3rd party. That's just one example of sharing the same
// RegularKey amongst various accounts and just one vulnerability.
//
//   "When you have something that's easy to do that makes entire classes of
//    attacks clearly and obviously impossible, you need a damn good reason
//    not to do it."  --  David Schwartz
//
// Why would we include the signingFor account in the blob to be signed?
//
// In the current signing scheme, the account that a signer is `signing
// for/on behalf of` is the tx_json.Account.
//
// Later we might support more levels of signing.  Suppose Bob is a signer
// for Alice, and Carol is a signer for Bob, so Carol can sign for Bob who
// signs for Alice.  But suppose Alice has two signers: Bob and Dave.  If
// Carol is a signer for both Bob and Dave, then the signature needs to
// distinguish between Carol signing for Bob and Carol signing for Dave.
//
// So, if we support multiple levels of signing, then we'll need to
// incorporate the "signing for" accounts into the signing data as well.
