// *NOTE*
//
// Features, or Amendments as they are called elsewhere, are enabled on the
// network at some specific time based on Validator voting.  Features are
// enabled using run-time conditionals based on the state of the amendment.
// There is value in retaining that conditional code for some time after
// the amendment is enabled to make it simple to replay old transactions.
// However, once an Amendment has been enabled for, say, more than two years
// then retaining that conditional code has less value since it is
// uncommon to replay such old transactions.
//
// Starting in January of 2020 Amendment conditionals from before January
// 2018 are being removed.  So replaying any ledger from before January
// 2018 needs to happen on an older version of the server code.  There's
// a log message in Application.cpp that warns about replaying old ledgers.
//
// At some point in the future someone may wish to remove Amendment
// conditional code for Amendments that were enabled after January 2018.
// When that happens then the log message in Application.cpp should be
// updated.
