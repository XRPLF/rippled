# Overlay

## Introduction

The _XRP Ledger network_ consists of a collection of _peers_ running
**`rippled`** or other compatible software. Each peer maintains multiple
outgoing connections and optional incoming connections to other peers.
These connections are made over both the public Internet and private local
area networks. This network defines a connected directed graph of nodes
where vertices are instances of `rippled` and edges are persistent TCP/IP
connections. Peers send and receive messages to other connected peers. This
peer to peer network, layered on top of the public and private Internet,
forms an [_overlay network_][overlay_network]. The contents of the messages
and the behavior of peers in response to the messages, plus the information
exchanged during the handshaking phase of connection establishment, defines
the _XRP Ledger peer protocol_ (or _protocol_ in this context).

## Overview

Each connection is represented by a _Peer_ object. The Overlay manager
establishes, receives, and maintains connections to peers. Protocol
messages are exchanged between peers and serialized using
[_Google Protocol Buffers_][protocol_buffers].

### Structure

Each connection between peers is identified by its connection type, which
affects the behavior of message routing. At present, only a single connection
type is supported: **Peer**.

## Handshake

To establish a protocol connection, a peer makes an outgoing TLS encrypted
connection to a remote peer, then sends an HTTP request with no message body.

### HTTP

The HTTP [request](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html) must:

- Use HTTP version 1.1.
- Specify a request URI consisting of a single forward slash character ("/")
indicating the server root. Requests using different URIs are reserved for
future protocol implementations.
- Use the [_HTTP/1.1 Upgrade_][upgrade_header] mechanism with additional custom
fields to communicate protocol specific information related to the upgrade.

HTTP requests which do not conform to this requirements must generate an
appropriate HTTP error and result in the connection being closed.

Upon receipt of a well-formed HTTP upgrade request, and validation of the
protocol specific parameters, a peer will either send back a HTTP 101 response
and switch to the requested protocol, or a message indicating that the request
failed (e.g. by sending HTTP 400 "Bad Request" or HTTP 503 "Service Unavailable").

#### Standard Fields

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `User-Agent`        	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|                   	|

The `User-Agent` field indicates the version of the software that the
peer that is making the HTTP request is using. No semantic meaning is
assigned to the value in this field but it is recommended that implementations
specify the version of the software that is used.

See [RFC2616 &sect;14.43](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43).

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Server`            	|                   	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The `Server` field indicates the version of the software that the
peer that is processing the HTTP request is using. No semantic meaning is
assigned to the value in this field but it is recommended that implementations
specify the version of the software that is used.

See [RFC2616 &sect;14.38](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.38).

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Connection`        	| :heavy_check_mark: 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The `Connection` field should have a value of `Upgrade` to indicate that a
request to upgrade the connection is being performed.

See [RFC2616 &sect;14.10](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.10).

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Upgrade`           	| :heavy_check_mark: 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The `Upgrade` field is part of the standard connection upgrade mechanism and
must be present in both requests and responses. It is used to negotiate the
version of the protocol that will be used after the upgrade request completes.

For requests, it should consist of a comma delimited list of at least one
element, where each element specifies a protocol version that the requesting
server is willing to use.

For responses, it should a consist of _single element_ matching one of the
elements provided in the corresponding request. If the server does not understand
any of the available protocol versions, the upgrade request should fail with an
appropriate HTTP error code (e.g. by sending an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" response).

Protocol versions are string of the form `XRPL/` followed by a dotted major
and minor protocol version number, where the major number is greater than or
equal to 2 and the minor is greater than or equal to 0. The legacy version
`RTXP/1.2` is also supported at this time and is an alias for `XRPL/2.0`.

See [RFC 2616 &sect;14.42](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.42)


#### Custom Fields

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Connect-As`        	| :heavy_check_mark: 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The mandatory `Connect-As` field is used to specify that type of connection
that is being requested.

For requests the value consists of a comma delimited list of elements, where
each element describes a possible connection type. Only one connection types
is supported at present: **`peer`**.

For responses, the value must consist of exactly one element from the list of
elements specified in the request. If a server processing a request does not
recognize any of the connection types, the request should fail with an
appropriate HTTP error code (e.g. by sending an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" response).


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Remote-IP`         	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

The optional `Remote-IP` field contains the string representation of the IP
address of the remote end of the connection as seen from the peer that is
sending the field.

By observing values of this field from a sufficient number of different
servers, a peer making outgoing connections can deduce its own IP address.


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Local-IP`          	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

The optional `Local-IP` field contains the string representation of the IP
address that the peer sending the field believes to be its own.

Servers receiving this field can detect IP address mismatches, which may
indicate a potential man-in-the-middle attack.


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Network-ID`        	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

The optional `Network-ID` can be used to identify to which of several
[parallel networks](https://xrpl.org/parallel-networks.html) the server
sending the field is joined.

The value, if the field is present, is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The
following well-known values are in use:

- **0**: The "main net"
- **1**: The Ripple-operated [Test Net](https://xrpl.org/xrp-test-net-faucet.html).

If a server configured to join one network receives a connection request from a
server configured to join another network, the request should fail with an
appropriate HTTP error code (e.g. by sending an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" response).


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Network-Time`      	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

The optional `Network-Time` field reports the current [time](https://xrpl.org/basic-data-types.html#specifying-time)
according to sender's internal clock.

Servers should fail a connection if their clocks are not within 20 seconds of
each other with an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g. by sending an HTTP 400
"Bad Request" response).

It is highly recommended that servers synchronize their clocks using time
synchronization software. For more on this topic, please visit [ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/).


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Public-Key`        	| :heavy_check_mark: 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The mandatory `Public-Key` field identifies the sending server's public key,
encoded in base58 using the standard encoding for node public keys.

See: https://xrpl.org/base58-encodings.html

| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Session-Signature` 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	| :heavy_check_mark: 	|

The `Session-Signature` field is mandatory and is used to secure the peer link
against certain types of attack. For more details see "Session Signature" below.

The value is presently encoded using **Base64** encoding, but implementations
should support both **Base64** and **HEX** encoding for this value.

For more details on this field, please see **Session Signature** below.
    
| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Crawl`             	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

The optional `Crawl` field can be used by a server to indicate whether peers
should include it in crawl reports.

The field can take two values:
- **`Public`**: The server's IP address and port should be included in crawl
reports.
- **`Private`**: The server's IP address and port should not be included in
crawl reports. _This is the default, if the field is omitted._

For more on the Peer Crawler, please visit https://xrpl.org/peer-crawler.html.


| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Closed-Ledger`     	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

If present, identifies the hash of the last ledger that the sending server
considers to be closed.

The value is presently encoded using **Base64** encoding, but implementations
should support both **Base64** and **HEX** encoding for this value.
    
| Field Name          	|  Request          	| Response          	|
|---------------------	|:-----------------:	|:-----------------:	|
| `Previous-Ledger`   	| :white_check_mark: 	| :white_check_mark: 	|

If present, identifies the hash of the parent ledger that the sending server
considers to be closed.

The value is presently encoded using **Base64** encoding, but implementations
should support both **Base64** and **HEX** encoding for this value.

#### Additional Headers

An implementation or operator may specify additional, optional fields
and values in both requests and responses.

Implementations should not reject requests because of the presence of fields
that they do not understand.


### Session Signature

Even for SSL/TLS encrypted connections, it is possible for an attacker to mount
relatively inexpensive MITM attacks that can be extremely hard to detect and
may afford the attacker the ability to intelligently tamper with messages
exchanged between the two endpoints.

This risk can be mitigated if at least one side has a certificate from a certificate
authority trusted by the other endpoint, but having a certificate is not always
possible (or even desirable) in a decentralized and permissionless network.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that two endpoints A and B know that they are
talking directly to each other over a single end-to-end SSL/TLS session instead
of two separate SSL/TLS sessions, with an attacker acting as a proxy.

The XRP Ledger protocol prevents this attack by leveraging the fact that the two
servers each have a node identity, in the form of **`secp256k1`** keypairs, and
use that to strongly bind the SSL/TLS session to the node identities of each of
the two servers at the end of the SSL/TLS session.

To do this we "reach into" the SSL/TLS session, and extract the **`finished`**
messages for the local and remote endpoints, and combine them to generate a unique
"fingerprint". By design, this fingerprint should be the same for both SSL/TLS
endpoints.

That fingerprint, which is never shared over the wire (since each endpoint will
calculate it independently), is then signed by each server using its public
**`secp256k1`** node identity and the signature is transferred over the SSL/TLS
encrypted link during the protocol handshake phase.

Each side of the link will verify that the provided signature is from the claimed
public key against the session's unique fingerprint. If this signature check fails
then the link **MUST** be dropped.

If an attacker, Eve, establishes two separate SSL sessions with Alice and Bob, the
fingerprints of the two sessions will be different, and Eve will not be able to
sign the fingerprint of her session with Bob with Alice's private key, or the
fingerprint of her session with Alice with Bob's private key, and so both A and
B will know that an active MITM attack is in progress and will close their
connections.

If Eve simply proxies the raw bytes, she will be unable to decrypt the data being
transferred between A and B and will not be able to intelligently tamper with the
message stream between Alice and Bob, although she may be still be able to inject
delays or terminate the link.


# Ripple Clustering #

A cluster consists of more than one Ripple server under common
administration that share load information, distribute cryptography
operations, and provide greater response consistency.

Cluster nodes are identified by their public node keys. Cluster nodes
exchange information about endpoints that are imposing load upon them.
Cluster nodes share information about their internal load status.  Cluster
nodes do not have to verify the cryptographic signatures on messages
received from other cluster nodes.

## Configuration ##

A server's public key can be determined from the output of the `server_info`
command.  The key is in the `pubkey_node` value, and is a text string
beginning with the letter `n`.  The key is maintained across runs in a
database.

Cluster members are configured in the `rippled.cfg` file under
`[cluster_nodes]`.  Each member should be configured on a line beginning
with the node public key, followed optionally by a space and a friendly
name.

Because cluster members can introduce other cluster members, it is not
necessary to configure every cluster member on every other cluster member.
If a hub and spoke system is used, it is sufficient to configure every
cluster member on the hub(s) and only configure the hubs on the spokes.
That is, each spoke does not need to be configured on every other spoke.

New spokes can be added as follows:

- In the new spoke's `[cluster_nodes]`, include each hub's public node key
- Start the spoke server and determine its public node key
- Configure each hub with the new spoke's public key
- Restart each hub, one by one
- Restart the spoke

## Transaction Behavior ##

When a transaction is received from a cluster member, several normal checks
are bypassed:

Signature checking is bypassed because we trust that a cluster member would
not relay a transaction with an incorrect signature.  Validators may wish to
disable this feature, preferring the additional load to get the additional
security of having validators check each transaction.

Local checks for transaction checking are also bypassed. For example, a
server will not reject a transaction from a cluster peer because the fee
does not meet its current relay fee.  It is preferable to keep the cluster
in agreement and permit confirmation from one cluster member to more
reliably indicate the transaction's acceptance by the cluster.

## Server Load Information ##

Cluster members exchange information on their server's load level. The load
level is essentially the amount by which the normal fee levels are multiplied
to get the server's fee for relaying transactions.

A server's effective load level, and the one it uses to determine its relay
fee, is the highest of its local load level, the network load level, and the
cluster load level. The cluster load level is the median load level reported
by a cluster member.

## Gossip ##

Gossip is the mechanism by which cluster members share information about
endpoints (typically IPv4 addresses) that are imposing unusually high load
on them.  The endpoint load manager takes into account gossip to reduce the
amount of load the endpoint is permitted to impose on the local server
before it is warned, disconnected, or banned.

Suppose, for example, that an attacker controls a large number of IP
addresses, and with these, he can send sufficient requests to overload a
server.  Without gossip, he could use these same addresses to overload all
the servers in a cluster.  With gossip, if he chooses to use the same IP
address to impose load on more than one server, he will find that the amount
of load he can impose before getting disconnected is much lower.

## Monitoring ##

The `peers` command will report on the status of the cluster. The `cluster`
object will contain one entry for each member of the cluster (either configured
or introduced by another cluster member). The `age` field is the number of
seconds since the server was last heard from. If the server is reporting an
elevated cluster fee, that will be reported as well.

In the `peers` object, cluster members will contain a `cluster` field set to `true`.
