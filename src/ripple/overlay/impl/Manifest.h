    Validator key manifests
    -----------------------

    Suppose the secret keys installed on a Ripple validator are compromised.  Not
    only do you have to generate and install new key pairs on each validator,
    EVERY rippled needs to have its config updated with the new public keys, and
    is vulnerable to forged validation signatures until this is done.  The
    solution is a new layer of indirection: A master secret key under
    restrictive access control is used to sign a "manifest": essentially, a
    certificate including the master public key, an ephemeral public key for
    verifying validations (which will be signed by its secret counterpart), a
    sequence number, and a digital signature.

    The manifest has two serialized forms: one which includes the digital
    signature and one which doesn't.  There is an obvious causal dependency
    relationship between the (latter) form with no signature, the signature
    of that form, and the (former) form which includes that signature.  In
    other words, a message can't contain a signature of itself.  The code
    below stores a serialized manifest which includes the signature, and
    dynamically generates the signatureless form when it needs to verify
    the signature.

    There are two stores of information within rippled related to manifests.
    An instance of ManifestCache stores, for each trusted validator, (a) its
    master public key, and (b) the most senior of all valid manifests it has
    seen for that validator, if any.  On startup, the [validator_keys] config
    entries are used to prime the manifest cache with the trusted master keys.
    At this point, the manifest cache has all the entries it will ever have,
    but none of them have manifests.  The [validation_manifest] config entry
    (which is the manifest for this validator) is then decoded and added to
    the manifest cache.  Other manifests are added as "gossip" is received
    from rippled peers.

    The other data store (which does not involve manifests per se) contains
    the set of active ephemeral validator keys.  Keys are added to the set
    when a manifest is accepted, and removed when that manifest is obsoleted.

    When an ephemeral key is compromised, a new signing key pair is created,
    along with a new manifest vouching for it (with a higher sequence number),
    signed by the master key.  When a rippled peer receives the new manifest,
    it verifies it with the master key and (assuming it's valid) discards the
    old ephemeral key and stores the new one.  If the master key itself gets
    compromised, a manifest with sequence number 0xFFFFFFFF will supersede a
    prior manifest and discard any existing ephemeral key without storing a
    new one.  Since no further manifests for this master key will be accepted
    (since no higher sequence number is possible), and no signing key is on
    record, no validations will be accepted from the compromised validator.
