/**
 *  Writer implements an O(1)-space, O(1)-granular output JSON writer.
 *
 *  O(1)-space means that it uses a fixed amount of memory, and that there are
 *  no heap allocations at each step of the way.
 *
 *  O(1)-granular output means the writer only outputs in small segments of a
 *  bounded size, using a bounded number of CPU cycles in doing so.  This is
 *  very helpful in scheduling long jobs.
 *
 *  The tradeoff is that you have to fill items in the JSON tree as you go,
 *  and you can never go backward.
 *
 *  Writer can write single JSON tokens, but the typical use is to write out an
 *  entire JSON object.  For example:
 *
 *      {
 *          Writer w (out);
 *
 *          w.startObject ();          // Start the root object.
 *          w.set ("hello", "world");
 *          w.set ("goodbye", 23);
 *          w.finishObject ();         // Finish the root object.
 *      }
 *
 *  which outputs the string
 *
 *      {"hello":"world","goodbye":23}
 *
 *  There can be an object inside an object:
 *
 *      {
 *          Writer w (out);
 *
 *          w.startObject ();                // Start the root object.
 *          w.set ("hello", "world");
 *
 *          w.startObjectSet ("subobject");  // Start a sub-object.
 *          w.set ("goodbye", 23);           // Add a key, value assignment.
 *          w.finishObject ();               // Finish the sub-object.
 *
 *          w.finishObject ();               // Finish the root-object.
 *      }
 *
 *  which outputs the string
 *
 *     {"hello":"world","subobject":{"goodbye":23}}.
 *
 *  Arrays work similarly
 *
 *      {
 *          Writer w (out);
 *          w.startObject ();           // Start the root object.
 *
 *          w.startArraySet ("hello");  // Start an array.
 *          w.append (23)               // Append some items.
 *          w.append ("skidoo")
 *          w.finishArray ();           // Finish the array.
 *
 *          w.finishObject ();          // Finish the root object.
 *      }
 *
 *  which outputs the string
 *
 *      {"hello":[23,"skidoo"]}.
 *
 *
 *  If you've reached the end of a long object, you can just use finishAll()
 *  which finishes all arrays and objects that you have started.
 *
 *      {
 *          Writer w (out);
 *          w.startObject ();           // Start the root object.
 *
 *          w.startArraySet ("hello");  // Start an array.
 *          w.append (23)               // Append an item.
 *
 *          w.startArrayAppend ()       // Start a sub-array.
 *          w.append ("one");
 *          w.append ("two");
 *
 *          w.startObjectAppend ();     // Append a sub-object.
 *          w.finishAll ();             // Finish everything.
 *      }
 *
 *  which outputs the string
 *
 *      {"hello":[23,["one","two",{}]]}.
 *
 *  For convenience, the destructor of Writer calls w.finishAll() which makes
 *  sure that all arrays and objects are closed.  This means that you can throw
 *  an exception, or have a coroutine simply clean up the stack, and be sure
 *  that you do in fact generate a complete JSON object.
