    These are used as fallbacks when we are bootstrapping and don't have
    a local cache, or when none of our addresses are functioning. Typically
    sources will represent things like static text in the config file, a
    separate local file with addresses, or a remote HTTPS URL that can
    be updated automatically. Another solution is to use a custom DNS server
    that hands out peer IP addresses when name lookups are performed.
