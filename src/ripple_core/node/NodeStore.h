/** Persistency layer for NodeObject

    A Node is a ledger object which is uniquely identified by a key, which is
    the 256-bit hash of the body of the node. The payload is a variable length
    block of serialized data.

    All ledger data is stored as node objects and as such, needs to be persisted
    between launches. Furthermore, since the set of node objects will in
    general be larger than the amount of available memory, purged node objects
    which are later accessed must be retrieved from the node store.
