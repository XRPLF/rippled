<div class="textblock"><p >The XRP Ledger has many and diverse stakeholders, and everyone deserves a chance to contribute meaningful changes to the code that runs the XRPL.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md42"></a>
Contributing</h1>
<p >We assume you are familiar with the general practice of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects">making contributions on GitHub</a>. This file includes only special instructions specific to this project.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md43"></a>
Before you start</h2>
<p >In general, contributions should be developed in your personal <a href="https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/fork">fork</a>.</p>
<p >The following branches exist in the main project repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>develop</code>: The latest set of unreleased features, and the most common starting point for contributions.</li>
<li><code>release</code>: The latest beta release or release candidate.</li>
<li><code>master</code>: The latest stable release.</li>
<li><code>gh-pages</code>: The documentation for this project, built by Doxygen.</li>
</ul>
<p >The tip of each branch must be signed. In order for GitHub to sign a squashed commit that it builds from your pull request, GitHub must know your verifying key. Please set up <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification">signature verification</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md44"></a>
Major contributions</h2>
<p >If your contribution is a major feature or breaking change, then you must first write an XRP Ledger Standard (XLS) describing it. Go to <a href="https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/discussions">XRPL-Standards</a>, choose the next available standard number, and open a discussion with an appropriate title to propose your draft standard.</p>
<p >When you submit a pull request, please link the corresponding XLS in the description. An XLS still in draft status is considered a work-in-progress and open for discussion. Please allow time for questions, suggestions, and changes to the XLS draft. It is the responsibility of the XLS author to update the draft to match the final implementation when its corresponding pull request is merged, unless the author delegates that responsibility to others.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md45"></a>
Before making a pull request</h2>
<p >Changes that alter transaction processing must be guarded by an <a href="https://xrpl.org/amendments.html">Amendment</a>. All other changes that maintain the existing behavior do not need an Amendment.</p>
<p >Ensure that your code compiles according to the build instructions in <a class="el" href="md____w_rippled_rippled_BUILD.html">`BUILD.md`</a>. If you create new source files, they must go under <code>src/ripple</code>. You will need to add them to one of the <a href="./Builds/CMake/RippledCore.cmake">source lists</a> in CMake.</p>
<p >Please write tests for your code. If you create new test source files, they must go under <code>src/test</code>. You will need to add them to one of the <a href="./Builds/CMake/RippledCore.cmake">source lists</a> in CMake. If your test can be run offline, in under 60 seconds, then it can be an automatic test run by <code>rippled --unittest</code>. Otherwise, it must be a manual test.</p>
<p >The source must be formatted according to the style guide below.</p>
<p >Header includes must be <a href="./Builds/levelization">levelized</a>.</p>
<p >Changes should be usually squashed down into a single commit. Some larger or more complicated change sets make more sense, and are easier to review if organized into multiple logical commits. Either way, all commits should fit the following criteria:</p><ul>
<li>Changes should be presented in a single commit or a logical sequence of commits. Specifically, chronological commits that simply reflect the history of how the author implemented the change, "warts and all", are not useful to reviewers.</li>
<li>Every commit should have a good message. to explain a specific aspects of the change.</li>
<li>Every commit should be signed.</li>
<li>Every commit should be well-formed (builds successfully, unit tests passing), as this helps to resolve merge conflicts, and makes it easier to use <code>git bisect</code> to find bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Good commit messages</h3>
<p >Refer to <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/">"How to Write a Git Commit Message"</a> for general rules on writing a good commit message.</p>
<p >In addition to those guidelines, please add one of the following prefixes to the subject line if appropriate.</p><ul>
<li><code>fix:</code> - The primary purpose is to fix an existing bug.</li>
<li><code>perf:</code> - The primary purpose is performance improvements.</li>
<li><code>refactor:</code> - The changes refactor code without affecting functionality.</li>
<li><code>test:</code> - The changes <em>only</em> affect unit tests.</li>
<li><code>docs:</code> - The changes <em>only</em> affect documentation. This can include code comments in addition to <code>.md</code> files like this one.</li>
<li><code>build:</code> - The changes <em>only</em> affect the build process, including CMake and/or Conan settings.</li>
<li><code>chore:</code> - Other tasks that don't affect the binary, but don't fit any of the other cases. e.g. formatting, git settings, updating Github Actions jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p >Whenever possible, when updating commits after the PR is open, please add the PR number to the end of the subject line. e.g. <code>test: Add unit tests for Feature X (#1234)</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
Pull requests</h2>
<p >In general, pull requests use <code>develop</code> as the base branch. (Hotfixes are an exception.)</p>
<p >If your changes are not quite ready, but you want to make it easily available for preliminary examination or review, you can create a "Draft" pull request. While a pull request is marked as a "Draft", you can rebase or reorganize the commits in the pull request as desired.</p>
<p >Github pull requests are created as "Ready" by default, or you can mark a "Draft" pull request as "Ready". Once a pull request is marked as "Ready", any changes must be added as new commits. Do not force-push to a branch in a pull request under review. (This includes rebasing your branch onto the updated base branch. Use a merge operation, instead or hit the "Update branch" button at the bottom of the Github PR page.) This preserves the ability for reviewers to filter changes since their last review.</p>
<p >A pull request must obtain <b>approvals from at least two reviewers</b> before it can be considered for merge by a Maintainer. Maintainers retain discretion to require more approvals if they feel the credibility of the existing approvals is insufficient.</p>
<p >Pull requests must be merged by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits">squash-and-merge</a> to preserve a linear history for the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
When and how to merge pull requests</h3>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
"Passed"</h4>
<p >A pull request should only have the "Passed" label added when it meets a few criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It must have two approving reviews as described above. (Exception: PRs that are deemed "trivial" only need one approval.)</li>
<li>All CI checks must be complete and passed. (One-off failures may be acceptable if they are related to a known issue.)</li>
<li>The PR must have a good commit message.<ul>
<li>If the PR started with a good commit message, and it doesn't need to be updated, the author can indicate that in a comment.</li>
<li>Any contributor, preferably the author, can leave a comment suggesting a commit message.</li>
<li>If the author squashes and rebases the code in preparation for merge, they should also ensure the commit message(s) are updated as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The PR branch must be up to date with the base branch (usually <code>develop</code>). This is usually accomplised by merging the base branch into the feature branch, but if the other criteria are met, the changes can be squashed and rebased on top of the base branch.</li>
<li>Finally, and most importantly, the author of the PR must positively indicate that the PR is ready to merge. That can be accomplished by adding the "Passed" label if their role allows, or by leaving a comment to the effect that the PR is ready to merge.</li>
</ol>
<p >Once the "Passed" label is added, a maintainer may merge the PR at any time, so don't use it lightly.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
Instructions for maintainers</h4>
<p >The maintainer should double-check that the PR has met all the necessary criteria, and can request additional information from the owner, or additional reviews, and can always feel free to remove the "Passed" label if appropriate. The maintainer has final say on whether a PR gets merged, and are encouraged to communicate and issues or concerns to other maintainers.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a> </p><h5>Most pull requests: "Squash and merge"</h5>
<p >Most pull requests don't need special handling, and can simply be merged using the "Squash and merge" button on the Github UI. Update the suggested commit message if necessary.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md52"></a> </p><h5>Slightly more complicated pull requests</h5>
<p >Some pull requests need to be pushed to <code>develop</code> as more than one commit. There are multiple ways to accomplish this. If the author describes a process, and it is reasonable, follow it. Otherwise, do a fast forward only merge (<code>--ff-only</code>) on the command line and push.</p>
<p >Either way, check that:</p><ul>
<li>The commits are based on the current tip of <code>develop</code>.</li>
<li>The commits are clean: No merge commits (except when reverse merging), no "[FOLD]" or "fixup!" messages.</li>
<li>All commits are signed. If the commits are not signed by the author, use <code>git commit --amend -S</code> to sign them yourself.</li>
<li>At least one (but preferably all) of the commits has the PR number in the commit message.</li>
</ul>
<p ><b>Never use the "Create a merge commit" or "Rebase and merge" functions!</b></p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a> </p><h5>Releases, release candidates, and betas</h5>
<p >All releases, including release candidates and betas, are handled differently from typical PRs. Most importantly, never use the Github UI to merge a release.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are two possible conditions that the <code>develop</code> branch will be in when preparing a release.<ol type="a">
<li>Ready or almost ready to go: There may be one or two PRs that need to be merged, but otherwise, the only change needed is to update the version number in <code><a class="el" href="BuildInfo_8cpp_source.html">BuildInfo.cpp</a></code>. In this case, merge those PRs as appropriate, updating the second one, and waiting for CI to finish in between. Then update <code><a class="el" href="BuildInfo_8cpp_source.html">BuildInfo.cpp</a></code>.</li>
<li>Several pending PRs: In this case, do not use the Github UI, because the delays waiting for CI in between each merge will be unnecessarily onerous. Instead, create a working branch (e.g. <code>develop-next</code>) based off of <code>develop</code>. Squash the changes from each PR onto the branch, one commit each (unless more are needed), being sure to sign each commit and update the commit message to include the PR number. You may be able to use a fast-forward merge for the first PR. The workflow may look something like: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">git fetch upstream</div>
<div class="line">git checkout upstream/develop</div>
<div class="line">git checkout -b develop-next</div>
<div class="line"># Use -S on the ff-only merge if prbranch1 isn&#39;t signed.</div>
<div class="line"># Or do another branch first.</div>
<div class="line">git merge --ff-only user1/prbranch1</div>
<div class="line">git merge --squash user2/prbranch2</div>
<div class="line">git commit -S</div>
<div class="line">git merge --squash user3/prbranch3</div>
<div class="line">git commit -S</div>
<div class="line">[...]</div>
<div class="line">git push --set-upstream origin develop-next</div>
<div class="line">&lt;/pre&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create the Pull Request with <code>release</code> as the base branch. If any of the included PRs are still open, <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords">use closing keywords</a> in the description to ensure they are closed when the code is released. e.g. "Closes #1234"</li>
<li>Instead of the default template, reuse and update the message from the previous release. Include the following verbiage somewhere in the description: <div class="fragment"><div class="line">The base branch is release. All releases (including betas) go in</div>
<div class="line">release. This PR will be merged with --ff-only (not squashed or</div>
<div class="line">rebased, and not using the GitHub UI) to both release and develop.</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Sign-offs for the three platforms usually occur offline, but at least one approval will be needed on the PR.</li>
<li>Once everything is ready to go, open a terminal, and do the fast-forward merges manually. Do not push any branches until you verify that all of them update correctly. <div class="fragment"><div class="line">git fetch upstream</div>
<div class="line">git checkout -b upstream--develop -t upstream/develop || git checkout upstream--develop</div>
<div class="line">git reset --hard upstream/develop</div>
<div class="line"># develop-next must be signed already!</div>
<div class="line">git merge --ff-only origin/develop-next</div>
<div class="line">git checkout -b upstream--release -t upstream/release || git checkout upstream--release</div>
<div class="line">git reset --hard upstream/release</div>
<div class="line">git merge --ff-only origin/develop-next</div>
<div class="line"># Only do these 3 steps if pushing a release. No betas or RCs</div>
<div class="line">git checkout -b upstream--master -t upstream/master || git checkout upstream--master</div>
<div class="line">git reset --hard upstream/master</div>
<div class="line">git merge --ff-only origin/develop-next</div>
<div class="line"># Check that all of the branches are updated</div>
<div class="line">git log -1 --oneline</div>
<div class="line"># The output should look like:</div>
<div class="line"># 02ec8b7962 (HEAD -&gt; upstream--master, origin/develop-next, upstream--release, upstream--develop, develop-next) Set version to 2.2.0-rc1</div>
<div class="line"># Note that all of the upstream--develop/release/master are on this commit.</div>
<div class="line"># (Master will be missing for betas, etc.)</div>
<div class="line"># Just to be safe, do a dry run first:</div>
<div class="line">git push --dry-run upstream-push HEAD:develop</div>
<div class="line">git push --dry-run upstream-push HEAD:release</div>
<div class="line"># git push --dry-run upstream-push HEAD:master</div>
<div class="line"># Now push</div>
<div class="line">git push upstream-push HEAD:develop</div>
<div class="line">git push upstream-push HEAD:release</div>
<div class="line"># git push upstream-push HEAD:master</div>
<div class="line"># Don&#39;t forget to tag the release, too.</div>
<div class="line">git tag &lt;version number&gt;</div>
<div class="line">git push upstream-push &lt;version number&gt;</div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Finally <a href="https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/releases">create a new release on Github</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md54"></a>
Style guide</h1>
<p >This is a non-exhaustive list of recommended style guidelines. These are not always strictly enforced and serve as a way to keep the codebase coherent rather than a set of <em>thou shalt not</em> commandments.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md55"></a>
Formatting</h2>
<p >All code must conform to <code>clang-format</code> version 10, according to the settings in <a href="./.clang-format"><code>.clang-format</code></a>, unless the result would be unreasonably difficult to read or maintain. To demarcate lines that should be left as-is, surround them with comments like this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">// clang-format off</div>
<div class="line">...</div>
<div class="line">// clang-format on</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >You can format individual files in place by running <code>clang-format -i &lt;file&gt;...</code> from any directory within this project.</p>
<p >There is a Continuous Integration job that runs clang-format on pull requests. If the code doesn't comply, a patch file that corrects auto-fixable formatting issues is generated.</p>
<p >To download the patch file:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Next to <code>clang-format / check (pull_request) Failing after #s</code> -&gt; click <b>Details</b> to open the details page.</li>
<li>Left menu -&gt; click <b>Summary</b></li>
<li>Scroll down to near the bottom-right under <code>Artifacts</code> -&gt; click <b>clang-format.patch</b></li>
<li>Download the zip file and extract it to your local git repository. Run <code>git apply [patch-file-name]</code>.</li>
<li>Commit and push.</li>
</ol>
<p >You can install a pre-commit hook to automatically run <code>clang-format</code> before every commit: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">pip3 install pre-commit</div>
<div class="line">pre-commit install</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
Contracts and instrumentation</h2>
<p >We are using <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a> for continuous fuzzing, and keep a copy of <a href="https://github.com/antithesishq/antithesis-sdk-cpp/">Antithesis C++ SDK</a> in <code>external/antithesis-sdk</code>. One of the aims of fuzzing is to identify bugs by finding external conditions which cause contracts violations inside <code>rippled</code>. The contracts are expressed as <code>XRPL_ASSERT</code> or <code>UNREACHABLE</code> (defined in <code><a class="el" href="instrumentation_8h_source.html">include/xrpl/beast/utility/instrumentation.h</a></code>), which are effectively (outside of Antithesis) wrappers for <code>assert(...)</code> with added name. The purpose of name is to provide contracts with stable identity which does not rely on line numbers.</p>
<p >When <code>rippled</code> is built with the Antithesis instrumentation enabled (using <code>voidstar</code> CMake option) and ran on the Antithesis platform, the contracts become <a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/properties.html">test properties</a>; otherwise they are just like a regular <code>assert</code>. To learn more about Antithesis, see <a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/introduction/how_antithesis_works.html">How Antithesis Works</a> and <a href="https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/sdk/cpp/overview.html#">C++ SDK</a></p>
<p >We continue to use the old style <code>assert</code> or <code>assert(false)</code> in certain locations, where the reporting of contract violations on the Antithesis platform is either not possible or not useful.</p>
<p >For this reason:</p><ul>
<li>The locations where <code>assert</code> or <code>assert(false)</code> contracts should continue to be used:<ul>
<li><code>constexpr</code> functions</li>
<li>unit tests i.e. files under <code>src/test</code></li>
<li>unit tests-related modules (files under <code>beast/test</code> and <code>beast/unit_test</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outside of the listed locations, do not use <code>assert</code>; use <code>XRPL_ASSERT</code> instead, giving it unique name, with the short description of the contract.</li>
<li>Outside of the listed locations, do not use <code>assert(false)</code>; use <code>UNREACHABLE</code> instead, giving it unique name, with the description of the condition being violated</li>
<li>The contract name should start with a full name (including scope) of the function, optionally a named lambda, followed by a colon <code>:</code> and a brief (typically at most five words) description. <code>UNREACHABLE</code> contracts can use slightly longer descriptions. If there are multiple overloads of the function, use common sense to balance both brevity and unambiguity of the function name. NOTE: the purpose of name is to provide stable means of unique identification of every contract; for this reason try to avoid elements which can change in some obvious refactors or when reinforcing the condition.</li>
<li>Contract description typically (except for <code>UNREACHABLE</code>) should describe the <em>expected</em> condition, as in "I assert that _expected_ is true".</li>
<li>Contract description for <code>UNREACHABLE</code> should describe the <em>unexpected</em> situation which caused the line to have been reached.</li>
<li>Example good name for an <code>UNREACHABLE</code> macro <code>"Json::operator==(Value, Value) : invalid type"</code>; example good name for an <code>XRPL_ASSERT</code> macro <code>"Json::Value::asCString : valid type"</code>.</li>
<li>Example <b>bad</b> name <code>"RFC1751::insert(char* s, int x, int start, int length) : length is greater than or equal zero"</code> (missing namespace, unnecessary full function signature, description too verbose). Good name: <code>"ripple::RFC1751::insert : minimum length"</code>.</li>
<li>In <b>few</b> well-justified cases a non-standard name can be used, in which case a comment should be placed to explain the rationale (example in <code><a class="el" href="contract_8cpp_source.html">contract.cpp</a></code>)</li>
<li>Do <b>not</b> rename a contract without a good reason (e.g. the name no longer reflects the location or the condition being checked)</li>
<li>Do not use <code>std::unreachable</code></li>
<li>Do not put contracts where they can be violated by an external condition (e.g. timing, data payload before mandatory validation etc.) as this creates bogus bug reports (and causes crashes of Debug builds)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Unit Tests</h2>
<p >To execute all unit tests:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">(Note: Using multiple cores on a Mac M1 can cause spurious test failures. The </div>
<div class="line">cause is still under investigation. If you observe this problem, try specifying fewer jobs.)</div>

<div class="line">To run a specific set of test suites:</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> rippled &ndash;unittest TestSuiteName ``<code> Note: In this example, all tests with prefix</code>TestSuiteName<code>will be run, so if </code>TestSuiteName1<code>and</code>TestSuiteName2` both exist, then both tests will run. Alternatively, if the unit test name finds an exact match, it will stop doing partial matches, i.e. if a unit test with a title of <code>TestSuiteName</code> exists, then no other unit test will be executed, apart from <code>TestSuiteName</code>.</p>
