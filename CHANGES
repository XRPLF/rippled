This file contains the history of changes in the SOCI library.

---
Version 4.0.0 differs from 3.2.x in the following ways:

- Provide context of the failure in soci_error::what() which now returns a
  longer and more useful message. Use the new get_error_message() method to get
  just the brief error message which used to be returned by what().

- Firebird
-- Add SOCI_FIREBIRD_EMBEDDED option to allow building with embedded library.
-- Throw an exception instead of truncating too long VARCHAR columns values.

- ODBC/MS SQL
-- Fix inserting strings of length greater than 8000 bytes into database.

- Oracle
-- Use SQLT_BDOUBLE for floating point values instead of SQLT_FLT.

---
Version 3.2.3 differs from 3.2.2 in the following ways:

- Improved Boost Tuple & Fusion integration by using boost::fusion::foreach
  to reference each member of a sequence. Breaks compatibility with Boost 1.35 (2008).
- Fixed linker error when building 64-bit target with Visual Studio.
- Fixed several issues with building using Cygwin and MinGW.
- Clarified documentation and examples on bulk operations.

- MySQL
-- Fixed building against MySQL 3.23.

- ODBC
- Improve readability of ODBC error messages.
- Fixed CMake configuration of ODBC backend for Visual Studio 64-bit targets.

- Oracle
-- We've had to disable Oracle target in the Travis CI configuration until we
   figure out how to setup Oracle on Travis CI directly.
   Therefore, this release hasn't been extensively tested against Oracle.

- PostgreSQL
-- Added support for UUID column type (tests and docs updated).

- SQLite3
-- Added sqlite3_soci_error exception as subclass of soci_error to provide useful
   exposure of specific SQLite3 error codes (tests and docs updated).

---
Version 3.0.0 differs from 2.2.0 in the following ways:

- Exposed the session's locale object.

- Moved the "no data" flag from indicators to statement.

- Allowed const objects as "use" elements.

- Added connection mode for Oracle.

- Added RAII support for transactions.

- Added the open/close/reconnect functionality.

- Added thread-safe connection pool.

- Added integrated support for Boost data types: gregorian_date,
  fusion and tuple.

- Added dynamic backend loading.

- Changed the naming convention to comply with Boost recommendations.

---
Version 2.2.0 differs from 2.1.0 in the following ways:

- Added true support for statement preparation with PostgreSQL.

- Added support for the stream-like extraction from Row.

- Added STL-compatible iterator interface for select statements.

- Refactored the set of common tests to validate core library functionality
  independently on the target database server.

- Introduced new backends for MS SQL Server (via ODBC) and Firebird.

- Provided complete build system for both Unix (autotools) and
  Windows (solution and project files for MSVC++).

---
Version 2.1.0 differs from 2.0.1 in the following ways:

- Added two additional backends: MySQL and SQLite3

- Restructured the source code layout so that the whole library was broken
  into the "core" part and independent "backends", each in its own
  directory together with appropriate tests.

- Provided basic Makefiles for static and shared libraries on
  Linux-compatible systems.

- Added the general class and function reference to the documentation.

---
Version 2.0.1 differs from 2.0.0 in the following ways:

- Corrected some typos in documentation.

- Corrected handling of dynamic rowset description for those backends
  which do not have dedicated description functionality.

- A bug fix to correctly handle std::tm in the Oracle backend.

- A bug fix to correctly handle object relational mapping when
  Values::set<T>() and Values::get<T>() are called where T is a
  TypeConversion-based type.

---
Version 2.0.0 differs from 1.2.1 in the following ways:

- The whole library was internally re-architectured to allow operation
  with many different backends. The top-level part of the library
  (the syntax layer) provides essentially the same interface as in previous
  versions of the library, but it can work with independent (and dynamically
  selected) backends, possibly targeting different database engines.
  As a prove of concept (and to encourage developments of new backends),
  the PostgreSQL backend was provided in addition to the Oracle one.
  During this re-architecturing, some minor bugs were fixed as well.

- The old Boost-style license was changed to the new (v. 1.0) Boost license.

---
The version 1.2.1 differs from 1.2.0 in the following ways:

- A bug was fixed that caused compile errors on MS VC++ compiler.

---
The version 1.2.0 differs from 1.1.0 in the following ways:

- A memory leak when reading into Row objects was fixed.

- Bulk (array) operations were introduced for high-performance
  applications, where the number of network round-trips can be
  significantly reduced by operating on whole arrays (vectors).

---
The version 1.1.0 differs from 1.0.1 in the following ways:

- Explicit support for calling stored procedures was added.

- Dynamic row recognition (type discovery) was added.

- Support for user-defined data types was added.
