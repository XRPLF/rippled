#
# Purpose
#
#   This file documents and provides examples of all rippled server process
#   configuration options. When the rippled server instance is launched, it
#   looks for a file with the following name:
#
#     rippled.cfg
#
#   For more information on where the rippled server instance searches for the
#   file, visit:
#
#     https://xrpl.org/commandline-usage.html#generic-options
#
#   This file should be named rippled.cfg. This file is UTF-8 with DOS, UNIX,
#   or Mac style end of lines. Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are
#   ignored. Undefined sections are reserved. No escapes are currently defined.
#
# Notation
#
#   In this document a simple BNF notation is used. Angle brackets denote
#   required elements, square brackets denote optional elements, and single
#   quotes indicate string literals. A vertical bar separating 1 or more
#   elements is a logical "or"; any one of the elements may be chosen.
#   Parentheses are notational only, and used to group elements; they are not
#   part of the syntax unless they appear in quotes. White space may always
#   appear between elements, it has no effect on values.
#
#       <key>       A required identifier
#       '='         The equals sign character
#       |           Logical "or"
#       ( )         Used for grouping
#
#
#   An identifier is a string of upper or lower case letters, digits, or
#   underscores subject to the requirement that the first character of an
#   identifier must be a letter. Identifiers are not case sensitive (but
#   values may be).
#
#   Some configuration sections contain key/value pairs. A line containing
#   a key/value pair has this syntax:
#
#       <identifier> '=' <value>
#
#   Depending on the section and key, different value types are possible:
#
#       <integer>   A signed integer
#       <unsigned>  An unsigned integer
#       <flag>      A boolean. 1 = true/yes/on, 0 = false/no/off.
#
#   Consult the documentation on the key in question to determine the possible
#   value types.

#
# 1. Server
#
#----------
#
#
#
#   rippled offers various server protocols to clients making inbound
#   connections. The listening ports rippled uses are "universal" ports
#   which may be configured to handshake in one or more of the available
#   supported protocols. These universal ports simplify administration:
#   A single open port can be used for multiple protocols.
#
#   NOTE    At least one server port must be defined in order
#           to accept incoming network connections.
#
#
# [server]
#
#   A list of port names and key/value pairs. A port name must start with a
#   letter and contain only letters and numbers. The name is not case-sensitive.
#   For each name in this list, rippled will look for a configuration file
#   section with the same name and use it to create a listening port. The
#   name is informational only; the choice of name does not affect the function
#   of the listening port.
#
#   Key/value pairs specified in this section are optional, and apply to all
#   listening ports unless the port overrides the value in its section. They
#   may be considered default values.
#
#   Suggestion:
#
#       To avoid a conflict with port names and future configuration sections,
#       we recommend prepending "port_" to the port name. This prefix is not
#       required, but suggested.
#
#   This example defines two ports with different port numbers and settings:
#
#       [server]
#       port_public
#       port_private
#       port = 80
#
#       [port_public]
#       ip = 0.0.0.0
#       port = 443
#       protocol = peer,https
#
#       [port_private]
#       ip = 127.0.0.1
#       protocol = http
#
#   When rippled is used as a command line client (for example, issuing a
#   server stop command), the first port advertising the http or https
#   protocol will be used to make the connection.
#
#
#
# [<name>]
#
#   A series of key/value pairs that define the settings for the port with
#   the corresponding name. These keys are possible:
#
#   ip = <IP-address>
#
#       Required. Determines the IP address of the network interface to bind
#       to. To bind to all available IPv4 interfaces, use 0.0.0.0
#       To binding to all IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces, use ::
#
#       NOTE    if the ip value is ::, then any incoming IPv4 connections will
#               be made as mapped IPv4 addresses.
#
#   port = <number>
#
#       Required. Sets the port number to use for this port.
#
#   protocol = [ http, https, peer ]
#
#       Required. A comma-separated list of protocols to support:
#
#       http        JSON-RPC over HTTP
#       https       JSON-RPC over HTTPS
#       ws          Websockets
#       wss         Secure Websockets
#       peer        Peer Protocol
#
#       Restrictions:
#
#       Only one port may be configured to support the peer protocol.
#       A port cannot have websocket and non websocket protocols at the
#       same time. It is possible have both Websockets and Secure Websockets
#       together in one port.
#
#       NOTE    If no ports support the peer protocol, rippled cannot
#               receive incoming peer connections or become a superpeer.
#
#   limit = <number>
#
#       Optional. An integer value that will limit the number of connected
#       clients that the port will accept. Once the limit is reached, new
#       connections will be refused until other clients disconnect.
#       Omit or set to 0 to allow unlimited numbers of clients.
#
#   user = <text>
#   password = <text>
#
#       When set, these credentials will be required on HTTP/S requests.
#       The credentials must be provided using HTTP's Basic Authentication
#       headers. If either or both fields are empty, then no credentials are
#       required. IP address restrictions, if any, will be checked in addition
#       to the credentials specified here.
#
#       When acting in the client role, rippled will supply these credentials
#       using HTTP's Basic Authentication headers when making outbound HTTP/S
#       requests.
#
#   admin = [ IP, IP, IP, ... ]
#
#       A comma-separated list of IP addresses.
#
#       When set, grants administrative command access to the specified IP
#       addresses. These commands may be issued over http, https, ws, or wss
#       if configured on the port. If not provided, the default is to not allow
#       administrative commands.
#
#       NOTE    A common configuration value for the admin field is "localhost".
#               If you are listening on all IPv4/IPv6 addresses by specifing
#               ip = :: then you can use admin = ::ffff:127.0.0.1,::1 to allow
#               administrative access from both IPv4 and IPv6 localhost
#               connections.
#
#       *SECURITY WARNING*
#       0.0.0.0 or :: may be used to allow access from any IP address. It must
#       be the only address specified and cannot be combined with other IPs.
#       Use of this address can compromise server security, please consider its
#       use carefully.
#
#   admin_user = <text>
#   admin_password = <text>
#
#       When set, clients must provide these credentials in the submitted
#       JSON for any administrative command requests submitted to the HTTP/S,
#       WS, or WSS protocol interfaces. If administrative commands are
#       disabled for a port, these credentials have no effect.
#
#       When acting in the client role, rippled will supply these credentials
#       in the submitted JSON for any administrative command requests when
#       invoking JSON-RPC commands on remote servers.
#
#   secure_gateway = [ IP, IP, IP, ... ]
#
#       A comma-separated list of IP addresses.
#
#       When set, allows the specified IP addresses to pass HTTP headers
#       containing username and remote IP address for each session. If a
#       non-empty username is passed in this way, then resource controls
#       such as often resulting in "tooBusy" errors will be lifted. However,
#       administrative RPC commands such as "stop" will not be allowed.
#       The HTTP headers that secure_gateway hosts can set are X-User and
#       X-Forwarded-For. Only the X-User header affects resource controls.
#       However, both header values are logged to help identify user activity.
#       If no X-User header is passed, or if its value is empty, then
#       resource controls will default to those for non-administrative users.
#
#       The secure_gateway IP addresses are intended to represent
#       proxies. Since rippled trusts these hosts, they must be
#       responsible for properly authenticating the remote user.
#
#       The same IP address cannot be used in both "admin" and "secure_gateway"
#       lists for the same port. In this case, rippled will abort with an error
#       message to the console shortly after startup
#
#   ssl_key = <filename>
#   ssl_cert = <filename>
#   ssl_chain = <filename>
#
#       Use the specified files when configuring SSL on the port.
#
#       NOTE    If no files are specified and secure protocols are selected,
#               rippled will generate an internal self-signed certificate.
#
#       The files have these meanings:
#
#       ssl_key
#
#           Specifies the filename holding the SSL key in PEM format.
#
#       ssl_cert
#
#           Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file in PEM format.
#           This is not needed if the chain includes it.
#
#       ssl_chain
#
#           If you need a certificate chain, specify the path to the
#           certificate chain here. The chain may include the end certificate.
#
#   ssl_ciphers = <cipherlist>
#
#       Control the ciphers which the server will support over SSL on the port,
#       specified using the OpenSSL "cipher list format".
#
#       NOTE    If unspecified, rippled will automatically configure a modern
#               cipher suite. This default suite should be widely supported.
#
#               You should not modify this string unless you have a specific
#               reason and cryptographic expertise. Incorrect modification may
#               keep rippled from connecting to other instances of rippled or
#               prevent RPC and WebSocket clients from connecting.
#
#   send_queue_limit = [1..65535]
#
#       A Websocket will disconnect when its send queue exceeds this limit.
#       The default is 100. A larger value may help with erratic disconnects but
#       may adversely affect server performance.
#
# WebSocket permessage-deflate extension options
#
#   These settings configure the optional permessage-deflate extension
#   options and may appear on any port configuration entry. They are meaningful
#   only to ports which have enabled a WebSocket protocol.
#
#   permessage_deflate = <flag>
#
#       Determines if permessage_deflate extension negotiations are enabled.
#       When enabled, clients may request the extension and the server will
#       offer the enabled extension in response.
#
#   client_max_window_bits = [9..15]
#   server_max_window_bits = [9..15]
#   client_no_context_takeover = <flag>
#   server_no_context_takeover = <flag>
#
#       These optional settings control options related to the permessage-deflate
#       extension negotiation. For precise definitions of these fields please see
#       the RFC 7692, "Compression Extensions for WebSocket":
#           https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692
#
#   compress_level = [0..9]
#
#       When set, determines the amount of compression attempted, where 0 is
#       the least amount and 9 is the most amount. Higher levels require more
#       CPU resources. Levels 1 through 3 use a fast compression algorithm,
#       while levels 4 through 9 use a more compact algorithm which uses more
#       CPU resources. If unspecified, a default of 3 is used.
#
#   memory_level = [1..9]
#
#       When set, determines the relative amount of memory used to hold
#       intermediate compression data. Higher numbers can give better compression
#       ratios at the cost of higher memory and CPU resources.
#
# [rpc_startup]
#
#   Specify a list of RPC commands to run at startup.
#
#   Examples:
#     { "command" : "server_info" }
#     { "command" : "log_level", "partition" : "ripplecalc", "severity" : "trace" }
#
#
#
# [websocket_ping_frequency]
#
#   <number>
#
#   The amount of time to wait in seconds, before sending a websocket 'ping'
#   message. Ping messages are used to determine if the remote end of the
#   connection is no longer available.
#
#
# [server_domain]
#
#   domain name
#
#   The domain under which a TOML file applicable to this server can be
#   found. A server may lie about its domain so the TOML should contain
#   a reference to this server by pubkey in the [nodes] array.
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 2. Peer Protocol
#
#-----------------
#
#   These settings control security and access attributes of the Peer to Peer
#   server section of the rippled process. Peer Protocol implements the
#   Ripple Payment protocol. It is over peer connections that transactions
#   and validations are passed from to machine to machine, to determine the
#   contents of validated ledgers.
#
#
#
# [ips]
#
#   List of hostnames or ips where the Ripple protocol is served.  A default
#   starter list is included in the code and used if no other hostnames are
#   available.
#
#   One address or domain name per line is allowed. A port may must be
#   specified after adding a space to the address.  The ordering of entries
#   does not generally matter.
#
#   The default list of entries is:
#     - r.ripple.com 51235
#     - zaphod.alloy.ee 51235
#     - sahyadri.isrdc.in 51235
#
#   Examples:
#
#   [ips]
#   192.168.0.1
#   192.168.0.1 2459
#   r.ripple.com 51235
#
#
# [ips_fixed]
#
#   List of IP addresses or hostnames to which rippled should always attempt to
#   maintain peer connections with. This is useful for manually forming private
#   networks, for example to configure a validation server that connects to the
#   Ripple network through a public-facing server, or for building a set
#   of cluster peers.
#
#   One address or domain names per line is allowed. A port must be specified
#   after adding a space to the address.
#
#
#
# [peer_private]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Request peers to broadcast your address. Normal outbound peer connections [default]
#   1: Request peers not broadcast your address. Only connect to configured peers.
#
#
#
# [peers_max]
#
#   The largest number of desired peer connections (incoming or outgoing).
#   Cluster and fixed peers do not count towards this total. There are
#   implementation-defined lower limits imposed on this value for security
#   purposes.
#
#
#
# [node_seed]
#
#   This is used for clustering. To force a particular node seed or key, the
#   key can be set here.  The format is the same as the validation_seed field.
#   To obtain a validation seed, use the validation_create command.
#
#   Examples:  RASH BUSH MILK LOOK BAD BRIM AVID GAFF BAIT ROT POD LOVE
#              shfArahZT9Q9ckTf3s1psJ7C7qzVN
#
#
#
# [cluster_nodes]
#
#   To extend full trust to other nodes, place their node public keys here.
#   Generally, you should only do this for nodes under common administration.
#   Node public keys start with an 'n'. To give a node a name for identification
#   place a space after the public key and then the name.
#
#
#
# [sntp_servers]
#
#   IP address or domain of NTP servers to use for time synchronization.
#
#   These NTP servers are suitable for rippled servers located in the United
#   States:
#      time.windows.com
#      time.apple.com
#      time.nist.gov
#      pool.ntp.org
#
#
#
# [max_transactions]
#
#   Configure the maximum number of transactions to have in the job queue
#
#   Must be a number between 100 and 1000, defaults to 250
#
#
# [overlay]
#
#   Controls settings related to the peer to peer overlay.
#
#   A set of key/value pair parameters to configure the overlay.
#
#   public_ip = <IP-address>
#
#       If the server has a known, fixed public IPv4 address,
#       specify that IP address here in dotted decimal notation.
#       Peers will use this information to reject attempt to proxy
#       connections to or from this server.
#
#   ip_limit = <number>
#
#       The maximum number of incoming peer connections allowed by a single
#       IP that isn't classified as "private" in RFC1918. The implementation
#       imposes some hard and soft upper limits on this value to prevent a
#       single host from consuming all inbound slots. If the value is not
#       present the server will autoconfigure an appropriate limit.
#
#   max_unknown_time = <number>
#
#       The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an outbound connection
#       is allowed to stay in the "unknown" tracking state. This option can
#       take any value between 300 and 1800 seconds, inclusive. If the option
#       is not present the server will autoconfigure an appropriate limit.
#
#       The current default (which is subject to change) is 600 seconds.
#
#   max_diverged_time = <number>
#
#       The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an outbound connection
#       is allowed to stay in the "diverged" tracking state. The option can
#       take any value between 60 and 900 seconds, inclusive. If the option
#       is not present the server will autoconfigure an appropriate limit.
#
#       The current default (which is subject to change) is 300 seconds.
#
#
# [transaction_queue] EXPERIMENTAL
#
#   This section is EXPERIMENTAL, and should not be
#   present for production configuration settings.
#
#   A set of key/value pair parameters to tune the performance of the
#   transaction queue.
#
#   ledgers_in_queue = <number>
#
#       The queue will be limited to this <number> of average ledgers'
#       worth of transactions. If the queue fills up, the transactions
#       with the lowest fee levels will be dropped from the queue any
#       time a transaction with a higher fee level is added.
#       Default: 20.
#
#   minimum_queue_size = <number>
#
#       The queue will always be able to hold at least this <number> of
#       transactions, regardless of recent ledger sizes or the value of
#       ledgers_in_queue. Default: 2000.
#
#   retry_sequence_percent = <number>
#
#       If a client replaces a transaction in the queue (same sequence
#       number as a transaction already in the queue), the new
#       transaction's fee must be more than <number> percent higher
#       than the original transaction's fee, or meet the current open
#       ledger fee to be considered. Default: 25.
#
#   minimum_escalation_multiplier = <number>
#
#       At ledger close time, the median fee level of the transactions
#       in that ledger is used as a multiplier in escalation
#       calculations of the next ledger. This minimum value ensures that
#       the escalation is significant. Default: 500.
#
#   minimum_txn_in_ledger = <number>
#
#       Minimum number of transactions that must be allowed into the
#       ledger at the minimum required fee before the required fee
#       escalates. Default: 5.
#
#   minimum_txn_in_ledger_standalone = <number>
#
#       Like minimum_txn_in_ledger when rippled is running in standalone
#       mode. Default: 1000.
#
#   target_txn_in_ledger = <number>
#
#       Number of transactions allowed into the ledger at the minimum
#       required fee that the queue will "work toward" as long as
#       consensus stays healthy. The limit will grow quickly until it
#       reaches or exceeds this number. After that the limit may still
#       change, but will stay above the target. If consensus is not
#       healthy, the limit will be clamped to this value or lower.
#       Default: 50.
#
#   maximum_txn_in_ledger = <number>
#
#       (Optional) Maximum number of transactions that will be allowed
#       into the ledger at the minimum required fee before the required
#       fee escalates. Default: no maximum.
#
#   normal_consensus_increase_percent = <number>
#
#       (Optional) When the ledger has more transactions than "expected",
#       and performance is humming along nicely, the expected ledger size
#       is updated to the previous ledger size plus this percentage.
#       Default: 20
#
#   slow_consensus_decrease_percent = <number>
#
#       (Optional) When consensus takes longer than appropriate, the
#       expected ledger size is updated to the minimum of the previous
#       ledger size or the "expected" ledger size minus this percentage.
#       Default: 50
#
#   maximum_txn_per_account = <number>
#
#       Maximum number of transactions that one account can have in the
#       queue at any given time. Default: 10.
#
#   minimum_last_ledger_buffer = <number>
#
#       If a transaction has a LastLedgerSequence, it must be at least
#       this much larger than the current open ledger sequence number.
#       Default: 2.
#
#   zero_basefee_transaction_feelevel = <number>
#
#       So we don't deal with infinite fee levels, treat any transaction
#       with a 0 base fee (ie. SetRegularKey password recovery) as
#       having this fee level.
#       Default: 256000.
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 3. Protocol
#
#-------------------
#
#   These settings affect the behavior of the server instance with respect
#   to protocol level activities such as validating and closing ledgers
#   adjusting fees in response to server overloads.
#
#
#
#
# [relay_proposals]
#
#   Controls the relay and processing behavior for proposals received by this
#   server that are issued by validators that are not on the server's UNL.
#
#   Legal values are:
#     "all"            - Relay and process all incoming proposals
#     "trusted"        - Relay only trusted proposals, but locally process all
#     "drop_untrusted" - Relay only trusted proposals, do not process untrusted
#
#   The default is "trusted".
#
#
# [relay_validations]
#
#   Controls the relay and processing behavior for validations received by this
#   server that are issued by validators that are not on the server's UNL.
#
#   Legal values are:
#     "all"            - Relay and process all incoming validations
#     "trusted"        - Relay only trusted validations, but locally process all
#     "drop_untrusted" - Relay only trusted validations, do not process untrusted
#
#   The default is "all".
#
#
#
#
#
# [ledger_history]
#
#   The number of past ledgers to acquire on server startup and the minimum to
#   maintain while running.
#
#   To serve clients, servers need historical ledger data. Servers that don't
#   need to serve clients can set this to "none".  Servers that want complete
#   history can set this to "full".
#
#   This must be less than or equal to online_delete (if online_delete is used)
#
#   The default is: 256
#
#
#
# [fetch_depth]
#
#   The number of past ledgers to serve to other peers that request historical
#   ledger data (or "full" for no limit).
#
#   Servers that require low latency and high local performance may wish to
#   restrict the historical ledgers they are willing to serve. Setting this
#   below 32 can harm network stability as servers require easy access to
#   recent history to stay in sync. Values below 128 are not recommended.
#
#   The default is: full
#
#
#
# [validation_seed]
#
#   To perform validation, this section should contain either a validation seed
#   or key.  The validation seed is used to generate the validation
#   public/private key pair.  To obtain a validation seed, use the
#   validation_create command.
#
#   Examples:  RASH BUSH MILK LOOK BAD BRIM AVID GAFF BAIT ROT POD LOVE
#              shfArahZT9Q9ckTf3s1psJ7C7qzVN
#
#
#
# [validator_token]
#
#   This is an alternative to [validation_seed] that allows rippled to perform
#   validation without having to store the validator keys on the network
#   connected server. The field should contain a single token in the form of a
#   base64-encoded blob.
#   An external tool is available for generating validator keys and tokens.
#
#
#
# [validator_key_revocation]
#
#   If a validator's secret key has been compromised, a revocation must be
#   generated and added to this field. The revocation notifies peers that it is
#   no longer safe to trust the revoked key. The field should contain a single
#   revocation in the form of a base64-encoded blob.
#   An external tool is available for generating and revoking validator keys.
#
#
#
# [validators_file]
#
#   Path or name of a file that determines the nodes to always accept as validators.
#
#   The contents of the file should include a [validators] and/or
#   [validator_list_sites] and [validator_list_keys] entries.
#   [validators] should be followed by a list of validation public keys of
#   nodes, one per line.
#   [validator_list_sites] should be followed by a list of URIs each serving a
#   list of recommended validators.
#   [validator_list_keys] should be followed by a list of keys belonging to
#   trusted validator list publishers. Validator lists fetched from configured
#   sites will only be considered if the list is accompanied by a valid
#   signature from a trusted publisher key.
#
#   Specify the file by its name or path.
#   Unless an absolute path is specified, it will be considered relative to
#   the folder in which the rippled.cfg file is located.
#
#   Examples:
#    /home/ripple/validators.txt
#    C:/home/ripple/validators.txt
#
#   Example content:
#    [validators]
#    n949f75evCHwgyP4fPVgaHqNHxUVN15PsJEZ3B3HnXPcPjcZAoy7
#    n9MD5h24qrQqiyBC8aeqqCWvpiBiYQ3jxSr91uiDvmrkyHRdYLUj
#    n9L81uNCaPgtUJfaHh89gmdvXKAmSt5Gdsw2g1iPWaPkAHW5Nm4C
#    n9KiYM9CgngLvtRCQHZwgC2gjpdaZcCcbt3VboxiNFcKuwFVujzS
#    n9LdgEtkmGB9E2h3K4Vp7iGUaKuq23Zr32ehxiU8FWY7xoxbWTSA
#
#
#
# [path_search]
#   When searching for paths, the default search aggressiveness. This can take
#   exponentially more resources as the size is increased.
#
#   The default is: 7
#
# [path_search_fast]
# [path_search_max]
#   When searching for paths, the minimum and maximum search aggressiveness.
#
#   If you do not need pathfinding, you can set path_search_max to zero to
#   disable it and avoid some expensive bookkeeping.
#
#   The default for 'path_search_fast' is 2. The default for 'path_search_max' is 10.
#
# [path_search_old]
#
#   For clients that use the legacy path finding interfaces, the search
#   aggressiveness to use. The default is 7.
#
#
#
# [fee_default]
#
#   Sets the base cost of a transaction in drops. Used when the server has
#   no other source of fee information, such as signing transactions offline.
#
#
#
# [workers]
#
#   Configures the number of threads for processing work submitted by peers
#   and clients. If not specified, then the value is automatically set to the
#   number of processor threads plus 2 for networked nodes. Nodes running in
#   stand alone mode default to 1 worker.
#
# [io_workers]
#
#   Configures the number of threads for processing raw inbound and outbound IO.
#
# [prefetch_workers]
#
#   Configures the number of threads for performing nodestore prefetching.
#
#
#
# [network_id]
#
#   Specify the network which this server is configured to connect to and
#   track. If set, the server will not establish connections with servers
#   that are explicitly configured to track another network.
#
#   Network identifiers are usually unsigned integers in the range 0 to
#   4294967295 inclusive. The server also maps the following well-known
#   names to the corresponding numerical identifier:
#
#   main    -> 0
#   testnet -> 1
#   devnet  -> 2
#
#   If this value is not specified the server is not explicitly configured
#   to track a particular network.
#
#
# [ledger_replay]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Disable the ledger replay feature [default]
#   1: Enable the ledger replay feature. With this feature enabled, when
#      acquiring a ledger from the network, a rippled node only downloads
#      the ledger header and the transactions instead of the whole ledger.
#      And the ledger is built by applying the transactions to the parent
#      ledger.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 4. HTTPS Client
#
#----------------
#
#   The rippled server instance uses HTTPS GET requests in a variety of
#   circumstances, including but not limited to contacting trusted domains to
#   fetch information such as mapping an email address to a Ripple Payment
#   Network address.
#
# [ssl_verify]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0. HTTPS client connections will not verify certificates.
#   1. Certificates will be checked for HTTPS client connections.
#
#   If not specified, this parameter defaults to 1.
#
#
#
# [ssl_verify_file]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#   A file system path leading to the certificate verification file for
#   HTTPS client requests.
#
#
#
# [ssl_verify_dir]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#
#   A file system path leading to a file or directory containing the root
#   certificates that the server will accept for verifying HTTP servers.
#   Used only for outbound HTTPS client connections.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 5. Reporting Mode
#
#------------
#
#   rippled has an optional operating mode called Reporting Mode. In Reporting
#   Mode, rippled does not connect to the peer to peer network. Instead, rippled
#   will continuously extract data from one or more rippled servers that are
#   connected to the peer to peer network (referred to as an ETL source).
#   Reporting mode servers will forward RPC requests that require access to the
#   peer to peer network (submit, fee, etc) to an ETL source.
#
#   [reporting]  Settings for Reporting Mode. If and only if this section is
#                present, rippled will start in reporting mode. This section
#                contains a list of ETL source names, and key-value pairs. The
#                ETL source names each correspond to a configuration file
#                section; the names must match exactly. The key-value pairs are
#                optional.
#
#
#   [<name>]
#
#   A series of key/value pairs that specify an ETL source.
#
#   source_ip = <IP-address>
#
#       Required. IP address of the ETL source. Can also be a DNS record.
#
#   source_ws_port = <number>
#
#       Required. Port on which ETL source is accepting unencrypted websocket
#       connections.
#
#   source_grpc_port = <number>
#
#       Required for ETL. Port on which ETL source is accepting gRPC requests.
#       If this option is ommitted, this ETL source cannot actually be used for
#       ETL; the Reporting Mode server can still forward RPCs to this ETL
#       source, but cannot extract data from this ETL source.
#
#
#   Key-value pairs (all optional):
#
#       read_only    Valid values: 0, 1. Default is 0. If set to 1, the server
#                    will start in strict read-only mode, and will not perform
#                    ETL. The server will still handle RPC requests, and will
#                    still forward RPC requests that require access to the p2p
#                    network.
#
#      start_sequence
#                   Sequence of first ledger to extract if the database is empty.
#                   ETL extracts ledgers in order. If this setting is absent and
#                   the database is empty, ETL will start with the next ledger
#                   validated by the network. If this setting is present and the
#                   database is not empty, an exception is thrown.
#
#     num_markers   Degree of parallelism used during the initial ledger
#                   download. Only used if the database is empty. Valid values
#                   are 1-256. A higher degree of parallelism results in a
#                   faster download, but puts more load on the ETL source.
#                   Default is 2.
#
#   Example:
#
#     [reporting]
#     etl_source1
#     etl_source2
#     read_only=0
#     start_sequence=32570
#     num_markers=8
#
#     [etl_source1]
#     source_ip=1.2.3.4
#     source_ws_port=6005
#     source_grpc_port=50051
#
#     [etl_source2]
#     source_ip=5.6.7.8
#     source_ws_port=6005
#     source_grpc_port=50051
#
#   Minimal Example:
#
#     [reporting]
#     etl_source1
#
#     [etl_source1]
#     source_ip=1.2.3.4
#     source_ws_port=6005
#     source_grpc_port=50051
#
#
#   Notes:
#
#   Reporting Mode requires Postgres (instead of SQLite). The Postgres
#   connection info is specified under the [ledger_tx_tables] config section;
#   see the Database section for further documentation.
#
#   Each ETL source specified must have gRPC enabled (by adding a [port_grpc]
#   section to the config). It is recommended to add a secure_gateway entry to
#   the gRPC section, in order to bypass the server's rate limiting.
#   This section needs to be added to the config of the ETL source, not
#   the config of the reporting node. In the example below, the
#   reporting server is running at 127.0.0.1. Multiple IPs can be
#   specified in secure_gateway via a comma separated list.
#
#   [port_grpc]
#   ip = 0.0.0.0
#   port = 50051
#   secure_gateway = 127.0.0.1
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 6. Database
#
#------------
#
#   rippled creates 4 SQLite database to hold bookkeeping information
#   about transactions, local credentials, and various other things.
#   It also creates the NodeDB, which holds all the objects that
#   make up the current and historical ledgers. In Reporting Mode, rippled
#   uses a Postgres database instead of SQLite.
#
#   The simplest way to work with Postgres is to install it locally.
#   When it is running, execute the initdb.sh script in the current
#   directory as: sudo -u postgres ./initdb.sh
#   This will create the rippled user and an empty database of the same name.
#
#   The size of the NodeDB grows in proportion to the amount of new data and the
#   amount of historical data (a configurable setting) so the performance of the
#   underlying storage media where the NodeDB is placed can significantly affect
#   the performance of the server.
#
#   Partial pathnames will be considered relative to the location of
#   the rippled.cfg file.
#
#   [node_db]               Settings for the Node Database (required)
#
#   Format (without spaces):
#       One or more lines of case-insensitive key / value pairs:
#       <key> '=' <value>
#       ...
#
#   Example:
#       type=nudb
#       path=db/nudb
#
#   The "type" field must be present and controls the choice of backend:
#
#   type = NuDB
#
#       NuDB is a high-performance database written by Ripple Labs and optimized
#       for rippled and solid-state drives.
#
#       NuDB maintains its high speed regardless of the amount of history
#       stored. Online delete may be selected, but is not required. NuDB is
#       available on all platforms that rippled runs on.
#
#   type = RocksDB
#
#       RocksDB is an open-source, general-purpose key/value store - see
#       http://rocksdb.org/ for more details.
#
#       RocksDB is an alternative backend for systems that don't use solid-state
#       drives.  Because RocksDB's performance degrades as it stores more data,
#       keeping full history is not advised, and using online delete is
#       recommended.
#
#   type = Cassandra
#
#       Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed key-value store - see
#       https://cassandra.apache.org/ for more details.
#
#       Cassandra is an alternative backend to be used only with Reporting Mode.
#       See the Reporting Mode section for more details about Reporting Mode.
#
#   Required keys for NuDB and RocksDB:
#
#       path                Location to store the database
#
#   Required keys for Cassandra:
#
#      contact_points       IP of a node in the Cassandra cluster
#
#      port                 CQL Native Transport Port
#
#      secure_connect_bundle
#                           Absolute path to a secure connect bundle. When using
#                           a secure connect bundle, contact_points and port are
#                           not required.
#
#      keyspace             Name of Cassandra keyspace to use
#
#      table_name           Name of table in above keyspace to use
#
#   Optional keys
#
#       cache_size          Size of cache for database records. Default is 16384.
#                           Setting this value to 0 will use the default value.
#
#       cache_age           Length of time in minutes to keep database records
#                           cached. Default is 5 minutes. Setting this value to
#                           0 will use the default value.
#
#                           Note: if neither cache_size nor cache_age is
#                           specified, the cache for database records will not
#                           be created. If only one of cache_size or cache_age
#                           is specified, the cache will be created using the
#                           default value for the unspecified parameter.
#
#                           Note: the cache will not be created if online_delete
#                           is specified, or if shards are used.
#
#       fast_load           Boolean. If set, load the last persisted ledger
#                           from disk upon process start before syncing to
#                           the network. This is likely to improve performance
#                           if sufficient IOPS capacity is available.
#                           Default 0.
#
#   Optional keys for NuDB or RocksDB:
#
#       earliest_seq        The default is 32570 to match the XRP ledger
#                           network's earliest allowed sequence. Alternate
#                           networks may set this value. Minimum value of 1.
#                           If a [shard_db] section is defined, and this
#                           value is present either [node_db] or [shard_db],
#                           it must be defined with the same value in both
#                           sections.
#
#       online_delete       Minimum value of 256. Enable automatic purging
#                           of older ledger information. Maintain at least this
#                           number of ledger records online. Must be greater
#                           than or equal to ledger_history.
#
#       These keys modify the behavior of online_delete, and thus are only
#       relevant if online_delete is defined and non-zero:
#
#       advisory_delete     0 for disabled, 1 for enabled. If set, the
#                           administrative RPC call "can_delete" is required
#                           to enable online deletion of ledger records.
#                           Online deletion does not run automatically if
#                           non-zero and the last deletion was on a ledger
#                           greater than the current "can_delete" setting.
#                           Default is 0.
#
#       delete_batch        When automatically purging, SQLite database
#                           records are deleted in batches. This value
#                           controls the maximum size of each batch. Larger
#                           batches keep the databases locked for more time,
#                           which may cause other functions to fall behind,
#                           and thus cause the node to lose sync.
#                           Default is 100.
#
#       back_off_milliseconds
#                           Number of milliseconds to wait between
#                           online_delete batches to allow other functions
#                           to catch up.
#                           Default is 100.
#
#       age_threshold_seconds
#                           The online delete process will only run if the
#                           latest validated ledger is younger than this
#                           number of seconds.
#                           Default is 60.
#
#       recovery_wait_seconds
#                           The online delete process checks periodically
#                           that rippled is still in sync with the network,
#                           and that the validated ledger is less than
#                           'age_threshold_seconds' old. By default, if it
#                           is not the online delete process aborts and
#                           tries again later. If 'recovery_wait_seconds'
#                           is set and rippled is out of sync, but likely to
#                           recover quickly, then online delete will wait
#                           this number of seconds for rippled to get back
#                           into sync before it aborts.
#                           Set this value if the node is otherwise staying
#                           in sync, or recovering quickly, but the online
#                           delete process is unable to finish.
#                           Default is unset.
#
#   Optional keys for Cassandra:
#
#       username            Username to use if Cassandra cluster requires
#                           authentication
#
#       password            Password to use if Cassandra cluster requires
#                           authentication
#
#       max_requests_outstanding
#                           Limits the maximum number of concurrent database
#                           writes. Default is 10 million. For slower clusters,
#                           large numbers of concurrent writes can overload the
#                           cluster. Setting this option can help eliminate
#                           write timeouts and other write errors due to the
#                           cluster being overloaded.
#       io_threads
#                           Set the number of IO threads used by the
#                           Cassandra driver. Defaults to 4.
#
#   Notes:
#       The 'node_db' entry configures the primary, persistent storage.
#
#       The 'import_db' is used with the '--import' command line option to
#           migrate the specified database into the current database given
#           in the [node_db] section.
#
#   [import_db]     Settings for performing a one-time import (optional)
#   [database_path]   Path to the book-keeping databases.
#
#   The server creates and maintains 4 to 5 bookkeeping SQLite databases in
#   the 'database_path' location. If you omit this configuration setting,
#   the server creates a directory called "db" located in the same place as
#   your rippled.cfg file.
#   Partial pathnames are relative to the location of the rippled executable.
#
#   [shard_db]      Settings for the Shard Database (optional)
#
#   Format (without spaces):
#       One or more lines of case-insensitive key / value pairs:
#       <key> '=' <value>
#       ...
#
#   Example:
#       path=db/shards/nudb
#
#   Required keys:
#       path                Location to store the database
#
#   Optional keys:
#       max_historical_shards
#                           The maximum number of historical shards
#                           to store.
#
#   [historical_shard_paths]      Additional storage paths for the Shard Database (optional)
#
#   Format (without spaces):
#       One or more lines, each expressing a full path for storing historical shards:
#       /mnt/disk1
#       /mnt/disk2
#       ...
#
#   [sqlite]       Tuning settings for the SQLite databases (optional)
#
#   Format (without spaces):
#       One or more lines of case-insensitive key / value pairs:
#       <key> '=' <value>
#       ...
#
#   Example 1:
#       safety_level=low
#
#   Example 2:
#       journal_mode=off
#       synchronous=off
#
#   WARNING: These settings can have significant effects on data integrity,
#   particularly in systemic failure scenarios. It is strongly recommended
#   that they be left at their defaults unless the server is having
#   performance issues during normal operation or during automatic purging
#   (online_delete) operations. A warning will be logged on startup if
#   'ledger_history' is configured to store more than 10,000,000 ledgers and
#   any of these settings are less safe than the default. This is due to the
#   inordinate amount of time and bandwidth it will take to safely rebuild a
#   corrupted database of that size from other peers.
#
#   Optional keys:
#
#       safety_level        Valid values: high, low
#                           The default is "high", which tunes the SQLite
#                           databases in the most reliable mode, and is
#                           equivalent to:
#                             journal_mode=wal
#                             synchronous=normal
#                             temp_store=file
#                           "low" is equivalent to:
#                             journal_mode=memory
#                             synchronous=off
#                             temp_store=memory
#                           These "low" settings trade speed and reduced I/O
#                           for a higher risk of data loss. See the
#                           individual settings below for more information.
#                           This setting may not be combined with any of the
#                           other tuning settings: "journal_mode",
#                           "synchronous", or "temp_store".
#
#       journal_mode        Valid values: delete, truncate, persist, memory, wal, off
#                           The default is "wal", which uses a write-ahead
#                           log to implement database transactions.
#                           Alternately, "memory" saves disk I/O, but if
#                           rippled crashes during a transaction, the
#                           database is likely to be corrupted.
#                           See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode
#                           for more details about the available options.
#                           This setting may not be combined with the
#                           "safety_level" setting.
#
#       synchronous         Valid values: off, normal, full, extra
#                           The default is "normal", which works well with
#                           the "wal" journal mode. Alternatively, "off"
#                           allows rippled to continue as soon as data is
#                           passed to the OS, which can significantly
#                           increase speed, but risks data corruption if
#                           the host computer crashes before writing that
#                           data to disk.
#                           See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous
#                           for more details about the available options.
#                           This setting may not be combined with the
#                           "safety_level" setting.
#
#       temp_store          Valid values: default, file, memory
#                           The default is "file", which will use files
#                           for temporary database tables and indices.
#                           Alternatively, "memory" may save I/O, but
#                           rippled does not currently use many, if any,
#                           of these temporary objects.
#                           See https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_temp_store
#                           for more details about the available options.
#                           This setting may not be combined with the
#                           "safety_level" setting.
#
#  [ledger_tx_tables] (optional)
#
#      conninfo             Info for connecting to Postgres. Format is
#                           postgres://[username]:[password]@[ip]/[database].
#                           The database and user must already exist. If this
#                           section is missing and rippled is running in
#                           Reporting Mode, rippled will connect as the
#                           user running rippled to a database with the
#                           same name. On Linux and Mac OS X, the connection
#                           will take place using the server's UNIX domain
#                           socket. On Windows, through the localhost IP
#                           address. Default is empty.
#
#      use_tx_tables        Valid values: 1, 0
#                           The default is 1 (true). Determines whether to use
#                           the SQLite transaction database. If set to 0,
#                           rippled will not write to the transaction database,
#                           and will reject tx, account_tx and tx_history RPCs.
#                           In Reporting Mode, this setting is ignored.
#
#      max_connections      Valid values: any positive integer up to 64 bit
#                           storage length. This configures the maximum
#                           number of concurrent connections to postgres.
#                           Default is the maximum possible value to
#                           fit in a 64 bit integer.
#
#      timeout              Number of seconds after which idle postgres
#                           connections are discconnected. If set to 0,
#                           connections never timeout. Default is 600.
#
#
#      remember_ip          Value values: 1, 0
#                           Default is 1 (true). Whether to cache host and
#                           port connection settings.
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 7. Diagnostics
#
#---------------
#
#   These settings are designed to help server administrators diagnose
#   problems, and obtain detailed information about the activities being
#   performed by the rippled process.
#
#
#
# [debug_logfile]
#
#   Specifies where a debug logfile is kept. By default, no debug log is kept.
#   Unless absolute, the path is relative the directory containing this file.
#
#   Example: debug.log
#
#
#
# [insight]
#
#   Configuration parameters for the Beast. Insight stats collection module.
#
#   Insight is a module that collects information from the areas of rippled
#   that have instrumentation. The configuration parameters control where the
#   collection metrics are sent. The parameters are expressed as key = value
#   pairs with no white space. The main parameter is the choice of server:
#
#     "server"
#
#       Choice of server to send metrics to. Currently the only choice is
#       "statsd" which sends UDP packets to a StatsD daemon, which must be
#       running while rippled is running. More information on StatsD is
#       available here:
#           https://github.com/b/statsd_spec
#
#       When server=statsd, these additional keys are used:
#
#       "address" The UDP address and port of the listening StatsD server,
#                 in the format, n.n.n.n:port.
#
#       "prefix"  A string prepended to each collected metric. This is used
#                 to distinguish between different running instances of rippled.
#
#     If this section is missing, or the server type is unspecified or unknown,
#     statistics are not collected or reported.
#
#   Example:
#
#     [insight]
#     server=statsd
#     address=192.168.0.95:4201
#     prefix=my_validator
#
# [perf]
#
#   Configuration of performance logging. If enabled, write Json-formatted
#   performance-oriented data periodically to a distinct log file.
#
#     "perf_log"      A string specifying the pathname of the performance log
#                     file. A relative pathname will log relative to the
#                     configuration directory. Required to enable
#                     performance logging.
#
#     "log_interval"  Integer value for number of seconds between writing
#                     to performance log. Default 1.
#
#   Example:
#     [perf]
#     perf_log=/var/log/rippled/perf.log
#     log_interval=2
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 8. Voting
#
#----------
#
#   The vote settings configure settings for the entire Ripple network.
#   While a single instance of rippled cannot unilaterally enforce network-wide
#   settings, these choices become part of the instance's vote during the
#   consensus process for each voting ledger.
#
# [voting]
#
#   A set of key/value pair parameters used during voting ledgers.
#
#   reference_fee = <drops>
#
#       The cost of the reference transaction fee, specified in drops.
#       The reference transaction is the simplest form of transaction.
#       It represents an XRP payment between two parties.
#
#       If this parameter is unspecified, rippled will use an internal
#       default. Don't change this without understanding the consequences.
#
#       Example:
#           reference_fee = 10           # 10 drops
#
#   account_reserve = <drops>
#
#       The account reserve requirement is specified in drops. The portion of an
#       account's XRP balance that is at or below the reserve may only be
#       spent on transaction fees, and not transferred out of the account.
#
#       If this parameter is unspecified, rippled will use an internal
#       default. Don't change this without understanding the consequences.
#
#       Example:
#           account_reserve = 20000000   # 20 XRP
#
#   owner_reserve = <drops>
#
#       The owner reserve is the amount of XRP reserved in the account for
#       each ledger item owned by the account. Ledger items an account may
#       own include trust lines, open orders, and tickets.
#
#       If this parameter is unspecified, rippled will use an internal
#       default. Don't change this without understanding the consequences.
#
#       Example:
#           owner_reserve = 5000000      # 5 XRP
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 9. Misc Settings
#
#-----------------
#
# [node_size]
#
#   Tunes the servers based on the expected load and available memory. Legal
#   sizes are "tiny", "small", "medium", "large", and "huge". We recommend
#   you start at the default and raise the setting if you have extra memory.
#
#   The code attempts to automatically determine the appropriate size for
#   this parameter based on the amount of RAM and the number of execution
#   cores available to the server. The current decision matrix is:
#
#   |         |         Cores          |
#   |---------|------------------------|
#   |   RAM   |   1  | 2 or 3 |   ≥ 4  |
#   |---------|------|--------|--------|
#   |  < ~8GB | tiny |   tiny |   tiny |
#   | < ~12GB | tiny |  small |  small |
#   | < ~16GB | tiny |  small | medium |
#   | < ~24GB | tiny |  small |  large |
#   | < ~32GB | tiny |  small |   huge |
#
# [signing_support]
#
#   Specifies whether the server will accept "sign" and "sign_for" commands
#   from remote users. Even if the commands are sent over a secure protocol
#   like secure websocket, this should generally be discouraged, because it
#   requires sending the secret to use for signing to the server. In order
#   to sign transactions, users should prefer to use a standalone signing
#   tool instead.
#
#   This flag has no effect on the "sign" and "sign_for" command line options
#   that rippled makes available.
#
#   The default value of this field is "false"
#
#   Example:
#
#   [signing_support]
#   true
#
# [crawl]
#
#   List of options to control what data is reported through the /crawl endpoint
#   See https://xrpl.org/peer-crawler.html
#
#   <flag>
#
#       Enable or disable access to /crawl requests. Default is '1' which
#       enables access.
#
#   overlay = <flag>
#
#       Report information about peers this server is connected to, similar
#       to the "peers" RPC API. Default is '1' which means to report peer
#       overlay info.
#
#   server = <flag>
#
#       Report information about the local server, similar to the "server_state"
#       RPC API. Default is '1' which means to report local server info.
#
#   counts = <flag>
#
#       Report information about the local server health counters, similar to
#       the "get_counts" RPC API. Default is '0' which means not to report
#       server counts.
#
#   unl = <flag>
#
#       Report information about the local server's validator lists, similar to
#       the "validators" and "validator_list_sites" RPC APIs. Default is '1'
#       which means to report server validator lists.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   [crawl]
#   0
#
#   [crawl]
#   overlay = 1
#   server = 1
#   counts = 0
#   unl = 1
#
# [vl]
#
#   Options to control what data is reported through the /vl endpoint
#   See [...]
#
#   enable = <flag>
#
#       Enable or disable access to /vl requests. Default is '1' which
#       enables access.
#
# [beta_rpc_api]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Disable the beta API version for JSON-RPC and WebSocket [default]
#   1: Enable the beta API version for testing. The beta API version
#      contains breaking changes that require a new API version number.
#      They are not ready for public consumption.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 10. Example Settings
#
#--------------------
#
#   Administrators can use these values as a starting point for configuring
#   their instance of rippled, but each value should be checked to make sure
#   it meets the business requirements for the organization.
#
# Server
#
#   These example configuration settings create these ports:
#
#   "peer"
#
#       Peer protocol open to everyone. This is required to accept
#       incoming rippled connections. This does not affect automatic
#       or manual outgoing Peer protocol connections.
#
#   "rpc"
#
#       Administrative RPC commands over HTTPS, when originating from
#       the same machine (via the loopback adapter at 127.0.0.1).
#
#   "wss_admin"
#
#       Admin level API commands over Secure Websockets, when originating
#       from the same machine (via the loopback adapter at 127.0.0.1).
#
#   This port is commented out but can be enabled by removing
#   the '#' from each corresponding line including the entry under [server]
#
#   "wss_public"
#
#       Guest level API commands over Secure Websockets, open to everyone.
#
#   For HTTPS and Secure Websockets ports, if no certificate and key file
#   are specified then a self-signed certificate will be generated on startup.
#   If you have a certificate and key file, uncomment the corresponding lines
#   and ensure the paths to the files are correct.
#
#   NOTE
#
#       To accept connections on well known ports such as 80 (HTTP) or
#       443 (HTTPS), most operating systems will require rippled to
#       run with administrator privileges, or else rippled will not start.

# This is primary persistent datastore for rippled.  This includes transaction
# metadata, account states, and ledger headers.  Helpful information can be
# found at https://xrpl.org/capacity-planning.html#node-db-type
# type=NuDB is recommended for non-validators with fast SSDs. Validators or
#    slow / spinning disks should use RocksDB. Caution: Spinning disks are
#    not recommended. They do not perform well enough to consistently remain
#    synced to the network.
# online_delete=512 is recommended to delete old ledgers while maintaining at
