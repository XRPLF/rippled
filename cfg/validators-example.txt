# The default validator list publishers that the rippled instance
# trusts.
#
# WARNING: Changing these values can cause your rippled instance to see a
#          validated ledger that contradicts other rippled instances'
#          validated ledgers (aka a ledger fork) if your validator list(s)
#          do not sufficiently overlap with the list(s) used by others.
