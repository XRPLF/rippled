# [validators]
#
#   List of the validation public keys of nodes to always accept as validators.
#
#   Manually listing validator keys is not recommended for production networks.
#   See validator_list_sites and validator_list_keys below.

#
# [validator_list_sites]
#
#   List of URIs serving lists of recommended validators.
#
#   Examples:
#    https://vl.ripple.com
#    https://vl.xrplf.org
#    http://127.0.0.1:8000

#
# [validator_list_keys]
#
#   List of keys belonging to trusted validator list publishers.
#   Validator lists fetched from configured sites will only be considered
#   if the list is accompanied by a valid signature from a trusted
#   publisher key.
#   Validator list keys should be hex-encoded.
#
#   Examples:

# The default validator list publishers that the rippled instance
# trusts.
#
# WARNING: Changing these values can cause your rippled instance to see a
#          validated ledger that contradicts other rippled instances'
#          validated ledgers (aka a ledger fork) if your validator list(s)
#          do not sufficiently overlap with the list(s) used by others.
#          See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07242.pdf

# [validator_list_threshold]
#
#   Minimum number of validator lists on which a validator must be listed in
#   order to be used.
#
#   This can be set explicitly to any positive integer number not greater than
#   the size of [validator_list_keys]. If it is not set, or set to 0, the
#   value will be calculated at startup from the size of [validator_list_keys],
#   where the calculation is:
#
#     threshold = size(validator_list_keys) < 3
#       ? 1
#       : floor(size(validator_list_keys) / 2) + 1
