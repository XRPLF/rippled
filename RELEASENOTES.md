# Change Log

- Work on a version 2 of the XRP Network API has begun.  The new API returns the code `notSynced` in place of `noClosed`, `noCurrent`, and `noNetwork`.  And `invalidLgrRange` is returned in place of `lgrIdxInvalid`.
- The version 2 API can be specified by adding "api_version" : 2 to your json request.  The default version remains 1 (if unspecified), except for the command line interface which always uses the latest verison.

# Releases

## Version 1.6.0

This release introduces several new features including changes to the XRP Ledger's consensus mechanism to make it even more robust in 
adverse conditions, as well as numerous bug fixes and optimizations.

### New and Improved Features

- Initial implementation of Negative UNL functionality: This change can improve the liveness of the network during periods of network instability, by allowing servers to track which validators are temporarily offline and to adjust quorum calculations to match. This change requires an amendment, but the amendment is not in the **1.6.0** release. Ripple expects to run extensive public testing for Negative UNL functionality on the Devnet in the coming weeks. If public testing satisfies all requirements across security, reliability, stability, and performance, then the amendment could be included in a version 2.0 release. [[#3380](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3380)]
- Validation Hardening: This change allows servers to detect accidental misconfiguration of validators, as well as potentially Byzantine behavior by malicious validators. Servers can now log a message to notify operators if they detect a single validator issuing validations for multiple, incompatible ledger versions, or validations from multiple servers sharing a key. As part of this update, validators report the version of `rippled` they are using, as well as the hash of the last ledger they consider to be fully validated, in validation messages. [[#3291](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3291)] ![Amendment: Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amendment-Required-red)
- Software Upgrade Monitoring & Notification: After the `HardenedValidations` amendment is enabled and the validators begin reporting the versions of `rippled` they are running, a server can check how many of the validators on its UNL run a newer version of the software than itself. If more than 60% of a server's validators are running a newer version, the server writes a message to notify the operator to consider upgrading their software. [[#3447](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3447)]
- Link Compression: Beginning with **1.6.0**, server operators can enable support for compressing peer-to-peer messages. This can save bandwidth at a cost of higher CPU usage. This support is disabled by default and should prove useful for servers with a large number of peers. [[#3287](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3287)]
- Unconditionalize Amendments that were enabled in 2017: This change removes legacy code which the network has not used since 2017. This change limits the ability to [replay](https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/issues/14) ledgers that rely on the pre-2017 behavior. [[#3292](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3292)]
- New Health Check Method: Perform a simple HTTP request to get a summary of the health of the server: Healthy, Warning, or Critical. [[#3365](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3365)]
- Start work on API version 2. Version 2 of the API will be part of a future release. The first breaking change will be to consolidate several closely related error messages that can occur when the server is not synced into a single "notSynced" error message. [[#3269](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3269)]
- Improved shard concurrency: Improvements to the shard engine have helped reduce the lock scope on all public functions, increasing the concurrency of the code. [[#3251](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3251)]
- Default Port: In the config file, the `[ips_fixed]` and `[ips]` stanzas now use the [IANA-assigned port](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=2459) for the XRP Ledger protocol (2459) when no port is specified. The `connect` API method also uses the same port by default. [[#2861](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2861)].
- Improve proposal and validation relaying. The peer-to-peer protocol always relays trusted proposals and validations (as part of the [consensus process](https://xrpl.org/consensus.html)), but only relays _untrusted_ proposals and validations in certain circumstances. This update adds configuration options so server operators can fine-tune how their server handles untrusted proposals and validations, and changes the default behavior to prioritize untrusted validations higher than untrusted proposals.  [[#3391](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3391)]
- Various Build and CI Improvements including updates to RocksDB 6.7.3 [[#3356](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3356)], NuDB 2.0.3 [[#3437](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3437)], adjusting CMake settings so that rippled can be built as a submodule [[#3449](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3449)], and adding Travis CI settings for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver [[#3319](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3319)].
- Better documentation in the config file for online deletion and database tuning. [[#3429](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3429)]


### Bug Fixes

- Fix the 14 day timer to enable amendment to start at the correct quorum size [[#3396](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3396)]
- Improve online delete backend lock which addresses a possibility in the online delete process where one or more backend shared pointer references may become invalid during rotation. [[#3342](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3342)]
- Address an issue that can occur during the loading of validator tokens, where a deliberately malformed token could cause the server to crash during startup. [[#3326](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3326)]
- Add delivered amount to GetAccountTransactionHistory. The delivered_amount field was not being populated when calling GetAccountTransactionHistory. In contrast, the delivered_amount field was being populated when calling GetTransaction. This change populates delivered_amount in the response to GetAccountTransactionHistory, and adds a unit test to make sure the results delivered by GetTransaction and GetAccountTransactionHistory match each other. [[#3370](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3370)]
- Fix build issues for GCC 10 [[#3393](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3393)]
- Fix historical ledger acquisition - this fixes an issue where historical ledgers were acquired only since the last online deletion interval instead of the configured value to allow deletion.[[#3369](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3369)]
- Fix build issue with Docker [#3416](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3416)]
- Add Shard family. The App Family utilizes a single shared Tree Node and Full Below cache for all history shards. This can create a problem when acquiring a shard that shares an account state node that was recently cached from another shard operation. The new Shard Family class solves this issue by managing separate Tree Node and Full Below caches for each shard. [#3448](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3448)]
- Amendment table clean up which fixes a calculation issue with majority. [#3428](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3428)]
- Add the `ledger_cleaner` command to rippled command line help [[#3305](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3305)]
- Various typo and comments fixes.


## Version 1.5.0

The `rippled` 1.5.0 release introduces several improvements and new features, including support for gRPC API, API versioning, UNL propagation via the peer network, new RPC methods `validator_info` and `manifest`, augmented `submit` method, improved `tx` method response, improved command line parsing, improved handshake protocol, improved package building and various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

This release also introduces two new amendments: `fixQualityUpperBound` and `RequireFullyCanonicalSig`.

Several improvements to the sharding system are currently being evaluated for inclusion into the upcoming 1.6 release of `rippled`. These changes are incompatible with shards generated by previous versions of the code. 
Additionally, an issue with the existing sharding engine can result in a server running versions 1.4 or 1.5 of the software to experience a deadlock and automatically restart when running with the sharding feature enabled. 
At this time, the developers recommend running with sharding disabled, pending the improvements scheduled to be introduced with 1.6. For more information on how to disable sharding, please visit https://xrpl.org/configure-history-sharding.html

 
**New and Updated Features**
- The `RequireFullyCanonicalSig` amendment which changes the signature requirements for the XRP Ledger protocol so that non-fully-canonical signatures are no longer valid. This protects against transaction malleability on all transactions, instead of just transactions with the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag enabled. Without this amendment, a transaction is malleable if it uses a secp256k1 signature and does not have tfFullyCanonicalSig enabled. Most signing utilities enable tfFullyCanonicalSig by default, but there are exceptions. With this amendment, no single-signed transactions are malleable. (Multi-signed transactions may still be malleable if signers provide more signatures than are necessary.) All transactions must use the fully canonical form of the signature, regardless of the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag. Signing utilities that do not create fully canonical signatures are not supported. All of Ripple's signing utilities have been providing fully-canonical signatures exclusively since at least 2014. For more information. [`ec137044a`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/ec137044a014530263cd3309d81643a5a3c1fdab)
- Native [gRPC API](https://grpc.io/) support. Currently, this API provides a subset of the full `rippled` [API](https://xrpl.org/rippled-api.html). You can enable the gRPC API on your server with a new configuration stanza. [`7d867b806`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/7d867b806d70fc41fb45e3e61b719397033b272c)
- API Versioning which allows for future breaking change of RPC methods to co-exist with existing versions. [`2aa11fa41`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/2aa11fa41d4a7849ae6a5d7a11df6f367191e3ef)
- Nodes now receive and broadcast UNLs over the peer network under various conditions. [`2c71802e3`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/2c71802e389a59118024ea0152123144c084b31c)
- Augmented `submit` method to include additional details on the status of the command. [`79e9085dd`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/79e9085dd1eb72864afe841225b78ec96e72b5ca)

- New `validator_info` method which returns information pertaining to the current validator's keys, manifest sequence, and domain. [`3578acaf0`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/3578acaf0b5f2d27ddc33f5b4cc81d21be1903ae)
- New `manifest` method which looks up manifest information for the specified key (either master or ephemeral). [`3578acaf0`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/3578acaf0b5f2d27ddc33f5b4cc81d21be1903ae)
- Introduce handshake protocol for compression negotiation (compression is not implemented at this point) and other minor improvements. [`f6916bfd4`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/f6916bfd429ce654e017ae9686cb023d9e05408b)
- Remove various old conditionals introduced by amendments. [`(51ed7db00`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/51ed7db0027ba822739bd9de6f2613f97c1b227b), [`6e4945c56)`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/6e4945c56b1a1c063b32921d7750607587ec3063)
- Add `getRippledInfo` info gathering script to `rippled` Linux packages. [`acf4b7889`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/acf4b78892074303cb1fa22b778da5e7e7eddeda)

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**
- The `fixQualityUpperBound` amendment which fixes a bug in unused code for estimating the ratio of input to output of individual steps in cross-currency payments. [`9d3626fec`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/9d3626fec5b610100f401dc0d25b9ec8e4a9a362)
- `tx` method now properly fetches all historical tx if they are incorporated into a validated ledger under rules that applied at the time. [`11cf27e00`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/11cf27e00698dbfc099b23463927d1dac829ed19)
- Fix to how `fail_hard` flag is handled with the `submit` method - transactions that are submitted with the `fail_hard` flag that result in any TER code besides tesSUCCESS is neither queued nor held. [`cd9732b47`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/cd9732b47a9d4e95bcb74e048d2c76fa118b80fb)
- Remove unused `Beast` code. [`172ead822`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/172ead822159a3c1f9b73217da4316df48851ab6)
- Lag ratchet code fix to use proper ephemeral public keys instead of the long-term master public keys.[`6529d3e6f`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/6529d3e6f7333fc5226e5aa9ae65f834cb93dfe5)


## Version 1.4.0

The `rippled` 1.4.0 release introduces several improvements and new features, including support for deleting accounts, improved peer slot management, improved CI integration and package building and support for [C++17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17) and [Boost 1.71](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_71_0.html). Finally, this release removes the code for the `SHAMapV2` amendment which failed to gain majority support and has been obsoleted by other improvements.
 
**New and Updated Features**
- The `DeletableAccounts` amendment which, if enabled, will make it possible for users to delete unused or unneeded accounts, recovering the account's reserve.
- Support for improved management of peer slots and the ability to add and removed reserved connections without requiring a restart of the server.
- Tracking and reporting of cumulative and instantaneous peer bandwidth usage. 
- Preliminary support for post-processing historical shards after downloading to index their contents.
- Reporting the master public key alongside the ephemeral public key in the `validation` stream [subscriptions](https://xrpl.org/subscribe.html).
- Reporting consensus phase changes in the `server` stream [subscription](https://xrpl.org/subscribe.html).

**Bug Fixes**
- The `fixPayChanRecipientOwnerDir` amendment which corrects a minor technical flaw that would cause a payment channel to not appear in the recipient's owner directory, which made it unnecessarily difficult for users to enumerate all their payment channels.
- The `fixCheckThreading` amendment which corrects a minor technical flaw that caused checks to not be properly threaded against the account of the check's recipient.
- Respect the `ssl_verify` configuration option in the `SSLHTTPDownloader` and `HTTPClient` classes.
- Properly update the `server_state` when a server detects a disagreement between itself and the network.
- Allow Ed25519 keys to be used with the `channel_authorize` command.

## Version 1.3.1

The `rippled` 1.3.1 release improves the built-in deadlock detection code, improves logging during process startup, changes the package build pipeline and improves the build documentation.

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**
- Add a LogicError when a deadlock is detected (355a7b04)
- Improve logging during process startup (7c24f7b1)

## Version 1.3.0
The `rippled` 1.3.0 release introduces several new features and overall improvements to the codebase, including the `fixMasterKeyAsRegularKey` amendment, code to adjust the timing of the consensus process and support for decentralized validator domain verification. The release also includes miscellaneous improvements including in the transaction censorship detection code, transaction validation code, manifest parsing code, configuration file parsing code, log file rotation code, and in the build, continuous integration, testing and package building pipelines.

**New and Updated Features**
- The `fixMasterKeyAsRegularKey` amendment which, if enabled, will correct a technical flaw that allowed setting an account's regular key to the account's master key.
- Code that allows validators to adjust the timing of the consensus process in near-real-time to account for connection delays.
- Support for decentralized validator domain verification by adding support for a "domain" field in manifests.

**Bug Fixes**
- Improve ledger trie ancestry tracking to reduce unnecessary error messages.
- More efficient detection of dry paths in the payment engine. Although not a transaction-breaking change, this should reduce spurious error messages in the log files.

## Version 1.2.4

The `rippled` 1.2.4 release improves the way that shard crawl requests are routed and the robustness of configured validator list retrieval by imposing a 20 second timeout.

**New and Updated Features**

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix a technical flaw in the fee escalation engine which could cause some fee metrics to be calculated incorrectly (4c06b3f86)

## Version 1.2.1

The `rippled` 1.2.1 release introduces several fixes including a change in the
information reported via the enhanced crawl functionality introduced in the
1.2.0 release, a fix for a potential race condition when processing a status
change message for a peer, and for a technical flaw that could cause a server
to not properly detect that it had lost all its peers.

The release also adds the `delivered_amount` field to more responses to simplify
the handling of payment or check cashing transactions.

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix a race condition during `TMStatusChange` handling (c8249981)
- Properly transition state to disconnected (9d027394)
- Display validator status only in response to admin requests (2d6a518a)
- Add the `delivered_amount` to more RPC commands (f2756914)


## Version 1.2.0

The `rippled` 1.2.0 release introduces the MultisignReserve Amendment, which
reduces the reserve requirement associated with signer lists. This release also
includes incremental improvements to the code that handles offers. Furthermore,
`rippled` now also has the ability to automatically detect transaction
censorship attempts and issue warnings of increasing severity for transactions
that should have been included in a closed ledger after several rounds of
consensus.

**New and Updated Features**

- Add safe_cast to sure no overflow in casts between enums and integral types (a7e4541)

## Version 1.1.2

The `rippled` 1.1.2 release introduces a fix for an issue that could have
prevented cluster peers from successfully bypassing connection limits when
connecting to other servers on the same cluster. Additionally, it improves
logic used to determine what the preferred ledger is during suboptimal
network conditions.

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

- Properly bypass connection limits for cluster peers (#2795, #2796)
- Improve preferred ledger calculation (#2784)

## Version 1.1.1

The `rippled` 1.1.1 release adds support for redirections when retrieving
validator lists and changes the way that validators with an expired list
behave. Additionally, informational commands return more useful information
to allow server operators to determine the state of their server

**New and Updated Features**

- Enhance status reporting when using the `server_info` and `validators` commands (#2734)
- Accept redirects from validator list sites: (#2715)

**Bug Fixes**

- Properly handle expired validator lists when validating (#2734)



## Version 1.1.0

The `rippled` 1.1.0 release release includes the `DepositPreAuth` amendment, which combined with the previously released `DepositAuth` amendment, allows users to pre-authorize incoming transactions to accounts, by whitelisting sender addresses. The 1.1.0 release also includes incremental improvements to several previously released features (`fix1515` amendment), deprecates support for the `sign` and `sign_for` commands from the rippled API and improves invariant checking for enhanced security.

Ripple recommends that all server operators upgrade to XRP Ledger version 1.1.0 by Thursday, 2018-09-27, to ensure service continuity.

**New and Updated Features**

- Add `DepositPreAuth` ledger type and transaction (#2513)

      encoding/decoding logic (RIPD-1618)
    - Avoid invoking undefined behavior in memcpy (RIPD-1616)
    - Limit STVar recursion during deserialization (RIPD-1603)
- Use lock when creating a peer shard rangeset


## Version 0.90.0

The `rippled` 0.90.0 release introduces several features and enhancements that improve the reliability, scalability and security of the XRP Ledger.

Highlights of this release include:

- The `DepositAuth` amendment, which lets an account strictly reject any incoming money from transactions sent by other accounts.
- The `Checks` amendment, which allows users to create deferred payments that can be cancelled or cashed by their intended recipients.
- **History Sharding**, which allows `rippled` servers to distribute historical ledger data if they agree to dedicate storage for segments of ledger history.
- New **Preferred Ledger by Branch** semantics which improve the logic that allow a server to decide which ledger it should base future ledgers on when there are multiple candidates.

## Version 0.60.0

The `rippled` 0.60.0 release introduces several enhancements that improve the reliability and scalability of the Ripple Consensus Ledger (RCL), including features that add ledger interoperability by improving Interledger Protocol compatibility. Ripple recommends that all server operators upgrade to version 0.60.0 by Thursday, 2017-03-30, for service continuity.

Highlights of this release include:

- `Escrow` (previously called `SusPay`) which permits users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date, and optionally a hashlock crypto-condition. Ripple expects Escrow to be enabled via an Amendment named [`Escrow`](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#escrow) on Thursday, 2017-03-30. See below for details.

## Version 0.50.3

The `rippled` 0.50.3 release corrects a reported exploit that would allow a combination of trust lines and order books in a payment path to bypass the blocking effect of the [`NoRipple`](https://ripple.com/build/understanding-the-noripple-flag/) flag. Ripple recommends that all server operators immediately upgrade to version 0.50.3.

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

Correct a reported exploit that would allow a combination of trust lines and order books in a payment path to bypass the blocking effect of the “NoRipple” flag.


## Version 0.50.2

The `rippled` 0.50.2 release adjusts the default TLS cipher list and corrects a flaw that would not allow an SSL handshake to properly complete if the port was configured using the `wss` keyword. Ripple recommends upgrading to 0.50.2 only if server operators are running rippled servers that accept client connections over TLS.

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

Adjust the default cipher list and correct a flaw that would not allow an SSL handshake to properly complete if the port was configured using the `wss` keyword (#1985)


## Version 0.50.0

The `rippled` 0.50.0 release includes TickSize, which allows gateways to set a "tick size" for assets they issue to help promote faster price discovery and deeper liquidity, as well as reduce transaction spam and ledger churn on RCL. Ripple expects TickSize to be enabled via an Amendment called TickSize on Tuesday, 2017-02-21.

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).

**New and Updated Features**

**Tick Size**

Currently, offers on RCL can differ by as little as one part in a quadrillion. This means that there is essentially no value to placing an offer early, as an offer placed later at a microscopically better price gets priority over it. The [TickSize](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#ticksize) Amendment solves this problem by introducing a minimum tick size that a price must move for an offer to be considered to be at a better price. The tick size is controlled by the issuers of the assets involved.

This change lets issuers quantize the exchange rates of offers to use a specified number of significant digits. Gateways must enable a TickSize on their account for this feature to benefit them. A single AccountSet transaction may set a `TickSize` parameter. Legal values are 0 and 3-15 inclusive. Zero removes the setting. 3-15 allow that many decimal digits of precision in the pricing of offers for assets issued by this account. It will still be possible to place an offer to buy or sell any amount of an asset and the offer will still keep that amount as exactly as it does now. If an offer involves two assets that each have a tick size, the smaller number of significant figures (larger ticks) controls.

For asset pairs with XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the tick size of the issuer of the non-XRP asset. For asset pairs without XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the smaller of the two issuer's configured tick sizes.

The tick size is imposed by rounding the offer quality down to the nearest tick and recomputing the non-critical side of the offer. For a buy, the amount offered is rounded down. For a sell, the amount charged is rounded up.

The primary expected benefit of the TickSize amendment is the reduction of bots fighting over the tip of the order book, which means:
- Quicker price discovery as outpricing someone by a microscopic amount is made impossible (currently bots can spend hours outbidding each other with no significant price movement)
- A reduction in offer creation and cancellation spam
- Traders can't outbid by a microscopic amount
- More offers left on the books as priority

We also expect larger tick sizes to benefit market makers in the following ways:
- They increase the delta between the fair market value and the trade price, ultimately reducing spreads
- They prevent market makers from consuming each other's offers due to slight changes in perceived fair market value, which promotes liquidity
- They promote faster price discovery by reducing the back and forths required to move the price by traders who don't want to move the price more than they need to
- They reduce transaction spam by reducing fighting over the tip of the order book and reducing the need to change offers due to slight price changes
- They reduce ledger churn and metadata sizes by reducing the number of indexes each order book must have
- They allow the order book as presented to traders to better reflect the actual book since these presentations are inevitably aggregated into ticks

**Hardened TLS configuration**

This release updates the default TLS configuration for rippled. The new release supports only 2048-bit DH parameters and defines a new default set of modern ciphers to use, removing support for ciphers and hash functions that are no longer considered secure.

Server administrators who wish to have different settings can configure custom global and per-port cipher suites in the configuration file using the `ssl_ciphers` directive.

**Upcoming Features**

We expect the previously announced Suspended Payments feature, which introduces new transaction types to the Ripple protocol that will permit users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL, to be enabled via the [SusPay](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#suspay) Amendment on Tuesday, 2017-02-21.

Also, we expect support for crypto-conditions, which are signature-like structures that can be used with suspended payments to support ILP integration, to be included in the next rippled release scheduled for March.

Lastly, we do not have an update on the previously announced changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, called [SHAMapV2](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2). At the time of activation, this amendment will require brief scheduled allowable unavailability while the changes to the hash tree structure are computed by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).


## Version 0.40.1

The `rippled` 0.40.1 release  increases SQLite database limits in all rippled servers. Ripple recommends upgrading to 0.40.1 only if server operators are running rippled servers with full-history of the ledger. There are no new or updated features in the 0.40.1 release.

You can update to the new version on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please compile the new version from source.

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

Increase SQLite database limits to prevent full-history servers from crashing when restarting. (#1961)

## Version 0.40.0

The `rippled` 0.40.0 release includes Suspended Payments, a new transaction type on the Ripple network that functions similar to an escrow service, which permits users cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date. Ripple expects Suspended Payments to be enabled via an Amendment named [SusPay](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#suspay) on Tuesday, 2017-01-17.

You can update to the new version on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please compile the new version from source.

**New and Updated Features**

Previously, Ripple announced the introduction of Payment Channels during the release of rippled version 0.33.0, which permit scalable, off-ledger checkpoints of high volume, low value payments flowing in a single direction. This was the first step in a multi-phase effort to make RCL more scalable and to support Interledger Protocol (ILP). Ripple expects Payment Channels to be enabled via an Amendment called [PayChan](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan) on a future date to be determined.

In the second phase towards making RCL more scalable and compatible with ILP, Ripple is introducing Suspended Payments, a new transaction type on the Ripple network that functions similar to an escrow service, which permits users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date. Ripple expects Suspended Payments to be enabled via an Amendment named [SusPay](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#suspay) on Tuesday, 2017-01-17.

A Suspended Payment can be created, which deducts the funds from the sending account. It can then be either fulfilled or canceled. It can only be fulfilled if the fulfillment transaction makes it into a ledger with a CloseTime lower than the expiry date of the transaction. It can be canceled with a transaction that makes it into a ledger with a CloseTime greater than the expiry date of the transaction.

In the third phase towards making RCL more scalable and compatible with ILP, Ripple plans to introduce additional library support for crypto-conditions, which are distributable event descriptions written in a standard format that describe how to recognize a fulfillment message without saying exactly what the fulfillment is. Fulfillments are cryptographically verifiable messages that prove an event occurred. If you transmit a fulfillment, then everyone who has the condition can agree that the condition has been met. Fulfillment requires the submission of a signature that matches the condition (message hash and public key). This format supports multiple algorithms, including different hash functions and cryptographic signing schemes. Crypto-conditions can be nested in multiple levels, with each level possibly having multiple signatures.

Lastly, we do not have an update on the previously announced changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, called [SHAMapV2](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2). This will require brief scheduled allowable downtime while the changes to the hash tree structure are propagated by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).

Consensus refactor (#1874)

Bug Fixes

Correct an issue in payment flow code that did not remove an unfunded offer (#1860)

Sign validator manifests with both ephemeral and master keys (#1865)

Correctly parse multi-buffer JSON messages (#1862)


## Version 0.33.0

The `rippled` 0.33.0 release includes an improved version of the payment code, which we expect to be activated via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-10-20 with the name [Flow](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#flow). We are also introducing XRP Payment Channels, a new structure in the ledger designed to support [Interledger Protocol](https://interledger.org/) trust lines as balances get substantial, which we expect to be activated via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name [PayChan](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan). Lastly, we will be introducing changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, which we expect to be available via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name [SHAMapV2](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2).

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).

** New and Updated Features **

A fixed version of the new payment processing engine, which we initially announced on Friday, 2016-07-29, is expected to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-10-20 with the name [Flow](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#flow). The new payments code adds no new features, but improves efficiency and robustness in payment handling.

The Flow code may occasionally produce slightly different results than the old payment processing engine due to the effects of floating point rounding.

We will be introducing changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, which we expect to be activated via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name [SHAMapV2](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2). The new structure is more compact and efficient than the previous version. This affects how ledger hashes are calculated, but has no other user-facing consequences. The activation of the SHAMapV2 amendment will require brief scheduled allowable downtime, while the changes to the hash tree structure are propagated by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).

In an effort to make RCL more scalable and to support Interledger Protocol (ILP) trust lines as balances get more substantial, we’re introducing XRP Payment Channels, a new structure in the ledger, which we expect to be available via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name [PayChan](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan).

XRP Payment Channels permit scalable, intermittent, off-ledger settlement of ILP trust lines for high volume payments flowing in a single direction. For bidirectional channels, an XRP Payment Channel can be used in each direction. The recipient can claim any unpaid balance at any time. The owner can top off the channel as needed. The owner must wait out a delay to close the channel to give the recipient a chance to supply any claims. The total amount paid increases monotonically as newer claims are issued.

The initial concept behind payment channels was discussed as early as 2011 and the first implementation was done by Mike Hearn in bitcoinj. Recent work being done by Lightning Network has showcased examples of the many use cases for payment channels. The introduction of XRP Payment Channels allows for a more efficient integration between RCL and ILP to further support enterprise use cases for high volume payments.

Prevent concurrent write operations in websockets [#1806]

Add HTTP status page for new websocket implementation [#1855]


## Version 0.32.1

The `rippled` 0.32.1 release includes an improved version of the payment code, which we expect to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-08-24 with the name FlowV2, and a completely new implementation of the WebSocket protocol for serving clients.

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).

**New and Updated Features**

An improved version of the payment processing engine, which we expect to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-08-24 with the name “FlowV2”. The new payments code adds no new features, but improves efficiency and robustness in payment handling.

The FlowV2 code may occasionally produce slightly different results than the old payment processing engine due to the effects of floating point rounding. Once FlowV2 is enabled on the network then old servers without the FlowV2 amendment will lose sync more frequently because of these differences.

**Beast WebSocket**

A completely new implementation of the WebSocket protocol for serving clients is available as a configurable option for `rippled` administrators. To enable this new implementation, change the “protocol” field in `rippled.cfg` from “ws” to “ws2” (or from “wss” to “wss2” for Secure WebSockets), as illustrated in this example:

    [port_ws_public]
    port = 5006
    ip = 0.0.0.0
    protocol = wss2

The new implementation paves the way for increased reliability and future performance when submitting commands over WebSocket. The behavior and syntax of commands should be identical to the previous implementation. Please report any issues to support@ripple.com. A future version of rippled will remove the old WebSocket implementation, and use only the new one.

**Bug fixes**

Fix a non-exploitable, intermittent crash in some client pathfinding requests (RIPD-1219)

Fix a non-exploitable crash caused by a race condition in the HTTP server. (RIPD-1251)

Fix bug that could cause a previously fee queued transaction to not be relayed after being in the open ledger for an extended time without being included in a validated ledger. Fix bug that would allow an account to have more than the allowed limit of transactions in the fee queue. Fix bug that could crash debug builds in rare cases when replacing a dropped transaction. (RIPD-1200)

Remove incompatible OS X switches in Test.py (RIPD-1250)

Autofilling a transaction fee (sign / submit) with the experimental `x-queue-okay` parameter will use the user’s maximum fee if the open ledger fee is higher, improving queue position, and giving the tx more chance to succeed. (RIPD-1194)



## Version 0.32.0

The `rippled` 0.32.0 release improves transaction queue which now supports batching and can hold up to 10 transactions per account, allowing users to queue multiple transactions for processing when the network load is high. Additionally, the `server_info` and `server_state` commands now include information on transaction cost multipliers and the fee command is available to unprivileged users. We advise rippled operators to upgrade immediately.

You can update to the new version on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please compile the new version from source.

**New and Updated Features**

- Allow multiple transactions per account in transaction queue (RIPD-1048). This also introduces a new transaction engine code, `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE`.
- Charge pathfinding consumers per source currency (RIPD-1019): The IP address used to perform pathfinding operations is now charged an additional resource increment for each source currency in the path set.
- New implementation of payment processing engine. This implementation is not yet enabled by default.
- Include amendments in validations subscription
- Add C++17 compatibility
- New WebSocket server implementation with Beast.WebSocket library. The new library offers a stable, high-performance websocket server implementation. To take advantage of this implementation, change websocket protocol under rippled.cfg from wss and ws to wss2 and ws2 under `[port_wss_admin]` and `[port_ws_public]` stanzas:
```
     [port_wss_admin]
     port = 51237
     ip = 127.0.0.1
     admin = 127.0.0.1
     protocol = wss2

     [port_ws_public]
     port = 51233
     ip = 0.0.0.0
     protocol = wss2, ws2
```
- The fee command is now public (RIPD-1113)
- The fee command checks open ledger rules (RIPD-1183)
- Log when number of available file descriptors is insufficient (RIPD-1125)
- Publish all validation fields for signature verification
- Get quorum and trusted master validator keys from validators.txt
- Standalone mode uses temp DB files by default (RIPD-1129): If a [database_path] is configured, it will always be used, and tables will be upgraded on startup.
- Include config manifest in server_info admin response (RIPD-1172)

**Bug fixes**

- Fix history acquire check (RIPD-1112)
- Correctly handle connections that fail security checks (RIPD-1114)
- Fix secured Websocket closing
- Reject invalid MessageKey in SetAccount handler (RIPD-308, RIPD-990)
- Fix advisory delete effect on history acquisition (RIPD-1112)
- Improve websocket send performance (RIPD-1158)
- Fix XRP bridge payment bug (RIPD-1141)
- Improve error reporting for wallet_propose command. Also include a warning if the key used may be an insecure, low-entropy key. (RIPD-1110)

**Deprecated features**

- Remove obsolete sendGetPeers support (RIPD-164)
- Remove obsolete internal command (RIPD-888)




## Version 0.31.2

The `rippled` 0.31.2 release corrects issues with the fee escalation algorithm. We advise `rippled` operators to upgrade immediately.

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

- A defect in the fee escalation algorithm that caused network fees to escalate more rapidly than intended has been corrected. (RIPD-1177)
- The minimum local fee advertised by validators will no longer be adjusted upwards.



## Version 0.31.1

The `rippled` 0.31.1 release contains one important bug fix. We advise `rippled` operators to upgrade immediately.

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).

**New and Updated Features**

This release has no new features.

**Bug Fixes**

`rippled` 0.31.1 contains the following fix:

- Correctly handle ledger validations with no `LedgerSequence` field. Previous versions of `rippled` incorrectly assumed that the optional validation field would always be included. Current versions of the software always include the field, and gracefully handle its absence.



## Version 0.31.0

`rippled` 0.31.0 has been released.

You can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum.

For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions). Use the `git log` command to confirm you have the correct source tree. The first log entry should be the change setting the version:


     commit a5d58566386fd86ae4c816c82085fe242b255d2c
     Author: Nik Bougalis <nikb@bougalis.net>
     Date:   Sun Apr 17 18:02:02 2016 -0700

         Set version to 0.31.0


**Warnings**

Please expect a one-time delay when starting 0.31.0 while certain database indices are being built or rebuilt. The delay can be up to five minutes, during which CPU will spike and the server will appear unresponsive (no response to RPC, etc.).

Additionally, `rippled` 0.31.0 now checks at start-up time that it has sufficient open file descriptors available, and shuts down with an error message if it does not. Previous versions of `rippled` could run out of file descriptors unexpectedly during operation. If you get a file-descriptor error message, increase the number of file descriptors available to `rippled` (for example, editing `/etc/security/limits.conf`) and restart.

**New and Updated Features**

`rippled` 0.31.0 has the following new or updated features:

- (New) [**Amendments**](https://ripple.com/build/amendments/) - A consensus-based system for introducing changes to transaction processing.
- (New) [**Multi-Signing**](https://ripple.com/build/transactions/#multi-signing) - (To be enabled as an amendment) Allow transactions to be authorized by a list of signatures. (RIPD-182)
- (New) **Transaction queue and FeeEscalation** - (To be enabled as an amendment) Include or defer transactions based on the [transaction cost](https://ripple.com/build/transaction-cost/) offered, for better behavior in DDoS conditions. (RIPD-598)
- (Updated) Validations subscription stream now includes `ledger_index` field. (DEC-564)
- (Updated) You can request SignerList information in the `account_info` command (RIPD-1061)

     Date:   Wed Oct 21 18:26:02 2015 -0700

        Set version to 0.30.0

This release incorporates a number of important features, bugfixes and functional improvements. Please refer to the [Git commit history](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/0.30.0) for more detailed information.

**Release Overview**

As part of Ripple Labs’ ongoing commitment toward protocol security, the rippled team would like to release rippled 0.30.0.

**Toolchain support**

The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow [these instructions](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8) if you have not upgraded already.

While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command **`scons -j[number of CPUs - 1]`**.

**New Features**

-   Honor markers in ledger\_data requests ([RIPD-1010](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1010)).
-   New Amendment - **TrustSetAuth** (Not currently enabled) Create zero balance trust lines with auth flag ([RIPD-1003](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1003)): this allows a TrustSet transaction to create a trust line if the only thing being changed is setting the tfSetfAuth flag.
-   Randomize the initial transaction execution order for closed ledgers based on the hash of the consensus set ([RIPD-961](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-961)). **Activates on October 27, 2015 at 11:00 AM PCT**.
-   Differentiate path\_find response ([RIPD-1013](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1013)).
-   Convert all of an asset ([RIPD-655](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-655)).

**Improvements**

-   SHAMap improvements.
-   Upgrade SQLite from 3.8.8.2 to 3.8.11.1.
-   Limit the number of offers that can be consumed during crossing ([RIPD-1026](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1026)).
-   Remove unfunded offers on tecOVERSIZE ([RIPD-1026](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1026)).
-   Improve transport security ([RIPD-1029](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1029)): to take full advantage of the improved transport security, servers with a single, static public IP address should add it to their configuration file, as follows:

     [overlay]
     public_ip=<ip_address>

**Development-Related Updates**

-   Transitional support for gcc 5.2: to enable support define the environmental variable `RIPPLED_OLD_GCC_ABI`=1
-   Transitional support for C++ 14: to enable support define the environment variable `RIPPLED_USE_CPP_14`=1
-   Visual Studio 2015 support
-   Updates to integration tests
-   Add uptime to crawl data ([RIPD-997](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-997))

Prior to building, please confirm you have the correct source tree with the **git log** command. The first log entry should be the change setting the version:

     commit 7efd0ab0d6ef017331a0e214a3053893c88f38a9
     Author: Vinnie Falco <vinnie.falco@gmail.com>
     Date:   Fri Apr 24 18:57:36 2015 -0700

        Set version to 0.28.0

This release incorporates a number of important features, bugfixes and functional improvements. Please refer to the [Git commit history](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/0.28.0) for more detailed information.

**Release Overview**

As part of Ripple Labs’ ongoing commitment toward improving the protocol, the rippled team is excited to announce **autobridging** — a feature that allows XRP to serve as a bridge currency. Autobridging enhances utility and has the potential to expose more of the network to liquidity and improve prices. For more information please refer to the [autobridging blog post](https://ripple.com/uncategorized/introducing-offer-autobridging/).

**Toolchain support**

The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow [these instructions](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8) if you have not upgraded already.

While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**\`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l\`**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command **scons -j\[number of CPUs - 1\]**.

**Important rippled.cfg update**

With rippled version 0.28, the rippled.cfg file must be changed according to these instructions:

-   Change any entries that say

`admin` `=` `allow` to `admin` `=` <IP address>

-   For most installations, 127.0.0.1 will preserve current behavior. 0.0.0.0 may be specified to indicate "any IP" but cannot be combined with other IP addresses. Use of 0.0.0.0 may introduce severe security risks and is not recommended. See docs/rippled-example.cfg for more information.

**More Strict Requirements on MemoType**

The requirements on the contents of the MemoType field, if present, are more strict than the previous version. Transactions that can successfully be submitted to 0.27.4 and earlier may fail in 0.28.0. For details, please refer to [updated memo documentation](https://ripple.com/build/transactions/#memos) for details. Partners should check their implementation to make sure that their MemoType follows the new rules.

## Version 0.27.0

rippled 0.27.0 has been released. The commit can be found on GitHub at: <https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/0.27.0>

Prior to building, please confirm you have the correct source tree with the **git log** command. The first log entry should be the change setting the version:

     commit c6c8e5d70c6fbde02cd946135a061aa77744396f
     Author: Vinnie Falco <vinnie.falco@gmail.com>
     Date:   Mon Jan 26 10:56:11 2015 -0800

         Set version to 0.27.0

This release incorporates a number of important bugfixes and functional improvements. Please refer to the [Git commit history](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/0.27.0) for more detailed information.

**Release Overview**

The rippled team is proud to release rippled 0.27.0. This new version includes many exciting features that will appeal to our users. The team continues to work on stability, scalability, and performance.

The first feature is Online Delete. This feature allows rippled to maintain it’s database of previous ledgers within a fixed amount of disk space. It does this while allowing rippled to stay online and maintain an administrator specify minimum number of ledgers. This means administrators with limited disk space will no longer need to manage disk space by periodically manually removing the database. Also, with the previously existing backend databases performance would gradually degrade as the database grew in size. In particular, rippled would perform poorly whenever the backend database performed ever growing compaction operations. By limiting rippled to less history, compaction is less resource intensive and systems with less disk performance can now run rippled.

Additionally, we are very excited to include Universal Port. This feature allows rippled's listening port to handshake in multiple protocols. For example, a single listening port can be configured to receive incoming peer connections, incoming RPC commands over HTTP, and incoming RPC commands over HTTPS at the same time. Or, a single port can receive both Websockets and Secure Websockets clients at the same.

Finally, a new, experimental backend database, NuDB, has been added. This database was developed by Ripple Labs to take advantage of rippled’s specific data usage profile and performs much better than previous databases. Significantly, this database does not degrade in performance as the database grows. Very excitingly, this database works on OS X and Windows. This allows rippled to use these platforms for the first time.

**Toolchain support**

The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow [these instructions](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8) if you have not upgraded already.

While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**\`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l\`**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command **scons -j\[number of CPUs - 1\]**.

The minimum supported version of Boost is v1.57.0. You **must** upgrade to this release or later to successfully compile this release of rippled. Please follow [these instructions](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Install_Boost) if you have not upgraded already.

**Important rippled.cfg Update**

**The format of the configuration file has changed. If upgrading from a previous version of rippled, please see the migration instructions below.**

**New Features**

-   SHAMapStore Online Delete ([RIPD-415](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-415)): Makes rippled configurable to support deletion of all data in its key-value store (nodestore) and ledger and transaction SQLite databases based on validated ledger sequence numbers. See doc/rippled-example.cfg for configuration setup.
-   [Universal Port](https://forum.ripple.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8313&p=57969). See necessary config changes below.
-   Config "ledger\_history\_index" option ([RIPD-559](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-559))

**Bug Fixes**

-   Fix pathfinding with multiple issuers for one currency ([RIPD-618](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-618))
-   Fix account\_lines, account\_offers and book\_offers result ([RIPD-682](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-682))
-   Fix pathfinding bugs ([RIPD-735](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-735))
-   Fix RPC subscribe with multiple books ([RIPD-77](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-77))
-   Fix account\_tx API

**Improvements**

-   Improve the human-readable description of the tesSUCCESS code
-   Add 'delivered\_amount' to Transaction JSON ([RIPD-643](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-643)): The synthetic field 'delivered\_amount' can be used to determine the exact amount delivered by a Payment without having to check the DeliveredAmount field, if present, or the Amount field otherwise.

**Development-Related Updates**

-   HTTP Handshaking for Peers on Universal Port ([RIPD-446](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-446))
-   Use asio signal handling in Application ([RIPD-140](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-140))
-   Build dependency on Boost 1.57.0
-   Support a "no\_server" flag in test config
-   API for improved Unit Testing ([RIPD-432](https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-432))
-   Option to specify rippled path on command line (--rippled=\<absolute or relative path\>)

**Experimental**

-   NuDB backend option: high performance key/value database optimized for rippled (set “type=nudb” in .cfg)

**Migration Instructions**

With rippled version 0.27.0, the rippled.cfg file must be changed according to these instructions:

-   Add new stanza - `[server]`. This section will contain a list of port names and key/value pairs. A port name must start with a letter and contain only letters and numbers. The name is not case-sensitive. For each name in this list, rippled will look for a configuration file section with the same name and use it to create a listening port. To simplify migration, you can use port names from your previous version of rippled.cfg (see Section 1. Server for detailed explanation in doc/rippled-example.cfg). For example:

         [server]
         rpc_port
         peer_port
         websocket_port
         ssl_key = <set value to your current [rpc_ssl_key] or [websocket_ssl_key] setting>
         ssl_cert = <set value to your current [rpc_ssl_cert] or [websocket_ssl_cert] setting>
         ssl_chain = <set value to your current [rpc_ssl_chain] or [websocket_ssl_chain] setting>

-   For each port name in `[server]` stanza, add separate stanzas. For example:

         [rpc_port]
         port = <set value to your current [rpc_port] setting, usually 5005>
         ip = <set value to your current [rpc_ip] setting, usually 127.0.0.1>
         admin = allow
         protocol = https

         [peer_port]
         port = <set value to your current [peer_port], usually 51235>
         ip = <set value to your current [peer_ip], usually 0.0.0.0>
         protocol = peer

         [websocket_port]
         port = <your current [websocket_port], usually 6006>
         ip = <your current [websocket_ip], usually 127.0.0.1>
         admin = allow
         protocol = wss

-   Remove current `[rpc_port],` `[rpc_ip],` `[rpc_allow_remote],` `[rpc_ssl_key],` `[rpc_ssl_cert],` `and` `[rpc_ssl_chain],` `[peer_port],` `[peer_ip],` `[websocket_port],` `[websocket_ip]` settings from rippled.cfg

-   If you allow untrusted websocket connections to your rippled, add `[websocket_public_port]` stanza under `[server]` section and replace websocket public settings with `[websocket_public_port]` section:

         [websocket_public_port]
         port = <your current [websocket_public_port], usually 5005>
         ip = <your current [websocket_public_ip], usually 127.0.0.1>
         protocol = ws ← make sure this is ws, not wss`

-   Remove `[websocket_public_port],` `[websocket_public_ip],` `[websocket_ssl_key],` `[websocket_ssl_cert],` `[websocket_ssl_chain]` settings from rippled.cfg
-   Disable `[ssl_verify]` section by setting it to 0
-   Migrate the remaining configurations without changes. To enable online delete feature, check Section 6. Database in doc/rippled-example.cfg

**Integration Notes**

With this release, integrators should deprecate the "DeliveredAmount" field in favor of "delivered\_amount."

**For Transactions That Occurred Before January 20, 2014:**

-   If amount actually delivered is different than the transactions “Amount” field
    -   "delivered\_amount" will show as unavailable indicating a developer should use caution when processing this payment.
    -   Example: A partial payment transaction (tfPartialPayment).
-   Otherwise
    -   "delivered\_amount" will show the correct destination balance change.

**For Transactions That Occur After January 20, 2014:**

-   If amount actually delivered is different than the transactions “Amount” field
    -   A "delivered\_amount" field will determine the destination amount change
    -   Example: A partial payment transaction (tfPartialPayment).
-   Otherwise
    -   "delivered\_amount" will show the correct destination balance change.

**Notice**

If you are upgrading from version 0.12 or earlier of rippled, these next sections apply to you because the format of the *rippled.cfg* file changed around that time. If you have upgraded since that time and you have applied the configuration file fixes, you can safely ignore them.

**Validators**

Ripple Labs is now running five validators. You can use this template for your *validators.txt* file (or place this in your config file):

     [validators]
     n9KPnVLn7ewVzHvn218DcEYsnWLzKerTDwhpofhk4Ym1RUq4TeGw    RIP1
     n9LFzWuhKNvXStHAuemfRKFVECLApowncMAM5chSCL9R5ECHGN4V    RIP2
     n94rSdgTyBNGvYg8pZXGuNt59Y5bGAZGxbxyvjDaqD9ceRAgD85P    RIP3
     n9LeQeDcLDMZKjx1TZtrXoLBLo5q1bR1sUQrWG7tEADFU6R27UBp    RIP4
     n9KF6RpvktjNs2MDBkmxpJbup4BKrKeMKDXPhaXkq7cKTwLmWkFr    RIP5

You should also raise your quorum to at least three by putting the following in your *rippled.cfg* file:

     [validation_quorum]
     3

If you are a validator, you should set your quorum to at least four.

**IPs**

A list of Ripple Labs server IP addresses can be found by resolving **r.ripple.com**. You can also add this to your *rippled.cfg* file to ensure you always have several peer connections to Ripple Labs servers:

     [ips]
     184.73.226.101 51235
     23.23.201.55   51235
     54.200.43.173  51235
     184.73.57.84   51235
     54.234.249.55  51235
     54.200.86.110  51235

**RocksDB back end**

RocksDB is based on LevelDB with improvements from Facebook and the community. Preliminary tests show that it stalls less often than HyperLevelDB for our use cases.

If you are switching over from an existing back end, you have two options. You can remove your old database and let rippled recreate it as it re-syncs, or you can import your old database into the new one.

To remove your old database, make sure the server is shut down (\`rippled stop\`). Remove the *db/ledger.db* and *db/transaction.db* files. Remove all the files in your back end store directory (*db/hashnode* by default). Then change your configuration file to use the RocksDB back end and restart.

To import your old database, start by shutting the server down. Then modify the configuration file by renaming your *\[node\_db\]* stanza to *\[import\_db\]*. Create a new *\[node\_db\]* stanza and specify a RocksDB back end with a different directory. Start the server with the command **rippled --import**. When the import finishes gracefully stop the server (\`rippled stop\`). Please wait for rippled to stop on its own because it can take several minutes for it to shut down after an import. Remove the old database, put the new database into place, remove the *\[import\_db\]* section, change the *\[node\_db\]* section to refer to the final location, and restart the server.

The recommended RocksDB configuration is:

     [node_db]
     type=RocksDB
     path=db/hashnode
     open_files=1200
     filter_bits=12
     cache_mb=128
     file_size_mb=8
     file_size_mult=2

**Configuring your Node DB**

You need to configure the [NodeBackEnd](https://wiki.ripple.com/NodeBackEnd) that you want the server to use. See above for an example RocksDB configuration.

-   **Note**: HyperLevelDB and RocksDB are not available on Windows platform.

       Set version to 0.20.1

**Major Partner Issues Fixed**

-   rippled will crash randomly.
    -   Entries in the three parts of the order book are missing or do not match. In such a case, rippled will crash.
-   Server loses sync randomly.
    -   This is due to rippled restarting after it crashes. That the server restarted is not obvious and appears to be something else.
-   Server goes 'offline' randomly.
    -   This is due to rippled restarting after it crashes. That the server restarted is not obvious and appears to be something else.
-   **complete\_ledgers** part of **server\_info** output says "None".
    -   This is due to rippled restarting and reconstructing the ledger after it crashes.
    -   If the node back end is corrupted or has been moved without being renamed in rippled.cfg, this can cause rippled to crash and restart.

**Validators**

Ripple Labs is now running five validators. You can use this template for your `validators.txt` file:

    [validators]
    n9KPnVLn7ewVzHvn218DcEYsnWLzKerTDwhpofhk4Ym1RUq4TeGw    RIP1
    n9LFzWuhKNvXStHAuemfRKFVECLApowncMAM5chSCL9R5ECHGN4V    RIP2
    n94rSdgTyBNGvYg8pZXGuNt59Y5bGAZGxbxyvjDaqD9ceRAgD85P    RIP3
    n9LeQeDcLDMZKjx1TZtrXoLBLo5q1bR1sUQrWG7tEADFU6R27UBp    RIP4
    n9KF6RpvktjNs2MDBkmxpJbup4BKrKeMKDXPhaXkq7cKTwLmWkFr    RIP5

You should also raise your quorum to at least three by putting the following in your `rippled.cfg` file:

    [validation_quorum]
    3

If you are a validator, you should set your quorum to at least four.

**IPs**

A list of Ripple Labs server IP addresses can be found by resolving `r.ripple.com`. You can also add this to your `rippled.cfg` file to ensure you always have several peer connections to Ripple Labs servers:

    [ips]
    54.225.112.220 51235
    54.225.123.13  51235
    54.227.239.106 51235
    107.21.251.218 51235
    184.73.226.101 51235
    23.23.201.55   51235

**Node DB**

You need to configure the [NodeBackEnd](https://wiki.ripple.com/NodeBackEnd) that you want the server to use. In most cases, that will mean adding this to your configuration file:

    [node_db]
    type=HyperLevelDB
    path=db/hashnode

-   NOTE HyperLevelDB is not available on Windows platforms.

**Release Candidates**

**Issues**

None known


-----------------------------------------------------------

## Version 0.12

rippled version 0.12 has now been released. This release is currently the tip of the [master branch](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/master) and can be found on GitHub. The tag is [v0.12.0](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/v0.12.0).

Prior to building, please confirm you have the correct source tree with the `git log` command. The first log entry should be the change setting the version:

    commit d0a9da6f16f4083993e4b6c5728777ffebf80f3a
    Author: JoelKatz <DavidJoelSchwartz@GMail.com>
    Date:   Mon Aug 26 12:08:05 2013 -0700

        Set version to v0.12.0

**Major Partner Issues Fixed**

-   Server Showing "Offline"

This issue was caused by LevelDB periodically compacting its internal data structure. While compacting, rippled's processing would stall causing the node to lose sync with the rest of the network. This issue was solved by switching from LevelDB to HyperLevelDB. rippled operators will need to change their ripple.cfg file. See below for configuration details.

-   Premature Validation of Transactions

On rare occasions, a transaction would show as locally validated before the full network consensus was confirmed. This issue was resolved by changing the way transactions are saved.

-   Missing Ledgers

Occasionally, some rippled servers would fail to fetch all ledgers. This left gaps in the local history and caused some API calls to report incomplete results. The ledger fetch code was rewritten to both prevent this and to repair any existing gaps.

**Significant Changes**

-   The way transactions are saved has been changed. This fixes a number of ways transactions can incorrectly be reported as fully-validated.
-   `doTransactionEntry` now works against open ledgers.
-   `doLedgerEntry` now supports a binary option.
-   A bug in `getBookPage` that caused it to skip offers is fixed.
-   `getNodeFat` now returns deeper chains, reducing ledger acquire latency.
-   Catching up if the (published ledger stream falls behind the network) is now more aggressive.
-   I/O stalls are drastically reduced by using the HyperLevelDB node back end.
-   Persistent ledger gaps should no longer occur.
-   Clusters now exchange load information.

**Validators**

Ripple Labs is now running five validators. You can use this template for your `validators.txt` file:

    [validators]
    n9KPnVLn7ewVzHvn218DcEYsnWLzKerTDwhpofhk4Ym1RUq4TeGw    RIP1

**Update April 2014** - Due to a vulnerability in OpenSSL the validator keys above have been cycled out, the five validators by RippleLabs use the following keys now:

    [validators]
    n949f75evCHwgyP4fPVgaHqNHxUVN15PsJEZ3B3HnXPcPjcZAoy7     RL1
    n9MD5h24qrQqiyBC8aeqqCWvpiBiYQ3jxSr91uiDvmrkyHRdYLUj     RL2
    n9L81uNCaPgtUJfaHh89gmdvXKAmSt5Gdsw2g1iPWaPkAHW5Nm4C     RL3

    n9LdgEtkmGB9E2h3K4Vp7iGUaKuq23Zr32ehxiU8FWY7xoxbWTSA     RL5

You should also raise your quorum to at least three by putting the following in your `rippled.cfg` file:

    [validation_quorum]
    3

If you are a validator, you should set your quorum to at least four.

**IPs**

A list of Ripple Labs server IP addresses can be found by resolving `r.ripple.com`. You can also add this to your `rippled.cfg` file to ensure you always have several peer connections to Ripple Labs servers:

    [ips]
    54.225.112.220 51235
    54.225.123.13  51235
    54.227.239.106 51235
    107.21.251.218 51235
    184.73.226.101 51235
    23.23.201.55   51235

**Node DB**

You need to configure the [NodeBackEnd](https://wiki.ripple.com/NodeBackEnd) that you want the server to use. In most cases, that will mean adding this to your configuration file:

    [node_db]
    type=HyperLevelDB
    path=db/hashnode

-   NOTE HyperLevelDB is not available on Windows platforms.

**Release Candidates**

RC1 was the first release candidate.

RC2 fixed a bug that could cause ledger acquires to stall.

RC3 fixed compilation under OSX.

RC4 includes performance improvements in countAccountTx and numerous small fixes to ledger acquisition.

RC5 changed the peer low water mark from 4 to 10 to acquire more server connections.

RC6 fixed some possible load issues with the network state timer and cluster reporting timers.

**Issues**

Fetching of historical ledgers is slower in this build than in previous builds. This is being investigated.
