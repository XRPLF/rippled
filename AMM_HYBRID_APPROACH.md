# AMM Hybrid Approach: Extending AMMCreate with Concentrated Liquidity

## Overview

This document describes a hybrid approach to implementing concentrated liquidity in the XRP Ledger's AMM system. Instead of creating separate transaction types, we extend the existing `AMMCreate` transaction with optional concentrated liquidity fields, providing backward compatibility while enabling advanced liquidity management.

## Key Design Principles

### What We Can Do (Hybrid Approach)
- **Extend AMMCreate** with optional concentrated liquidity fields
- **Add optional fields** to the `ltAMM` ledger object
- **Use feature flags** for backward compatibility
- **Maintain existing AMM functionality** for traditional liquidity provision

### What We Cannot Do (Limitations)
- **Add position management** to existing `AMMDeposit`/`AMMWithdraw`
- **Implement tick crossing** in existing payment engine
- **Add fee growth tracking** to existing AMMs
- **Modify existing AMM behavior** without breaking changes

## Implementation Details

### Extended AMMCreate Transaction

The `AMMCreate` transaction now supports optional concentrated liquidity fields:

```cpp
TRANSACTION(ttAMM_CREATE, 35, AMMCreate, Delegation::delegatable, ({
    {sfAmount, soeREQUIRED},
    {sfAmount2, soeREQUIRED},
    {sfTradingFee, soeREQUIRED},
    {sfTickLower, soeOPTIONAL},      // NEW: Lower tick boundary
    {sfTickUpper, soeOPTIONAL},      // NEW: Upper tick boundary
    {sfLiquidity, soeOPTIONAL},      // NEW: Initial liquidity amount
    {sfTickSpacing, soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Tick spacing for gas optimization
}))
```

### Extended ltAMM Ledger Object

The `ltAMM` ledger object is extended with optional concentrated liquidity fields:

```cpp
LEDGER_ENTRY(ltAMM, 0x0079, AMM, amm, ({
    // ... existing fields ...
    {sfCurrentTick,          soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Current tick index
    {sfSqrtPriceX64,         soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Current sqrt price in Q64.64 format
    {sfAggregatedLiquidity,  soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Total aggregated liquidity
    {sfFeeGrowthGlobal0X128, soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Global fee growth for asset 0
    {sfFeeGrowthGlobal1X128, soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Global fee growth for asset 1
    {sfTickSpacing,          soeOPTIONAL},    // NEW: Tick spacing for this AMM
}))
```

### Feature Flag Control

Concentrated liquidity functionality is controlled by the `featureAMMConcentratedLiquidity` feature flag:

- **When enabled**: AMMCreate can include concentrated liquidity fields
- **When disabled**: Only traditional AMM creation is allowed
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing AMMs continue to function normally

## Usage Examples

### Traditional AMM Creation (No Change)

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "AMMCreate",
  "Account": "rAlice...",
  "Amount": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "issuer": "rGateway...",
    "value": "100"
  },
  "Amount2": {
    "currency": "BTC",
    "issuer": "rGateway...",
    "value": "0.1"
  },
  "TradingFee": 30
}
```

### Concentrated Liquidity AMM Creation (New)

```json
{
  "TransactionType": "AMMCreate",
  "Account": "rAlice...",
  "Amount": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "issuer": "rGateway...",
    "value": "100"
  },
  "Amount2": {
    "currency": "BTC",
    "issuer": "rGateway...",
    "value": "0.1"
  },
  "TradingFee": 30,
  "TickLower": -1000,
  "TickUpper": 1000,
  "Liquidity": "1000000",
  "TickSpacing": 10
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Concentrated Liquidity Validation

When concentrated liquidity fields are present, the following validations apply:

1. **Feature Flag**: `featureAMMConcentratedLiquidity` must be enabled
2. **Complete Fields**: All concentrated liquidity fields must be present
3. **Tick Range**: `TickLower < TickUpper`
4. **Tick Bounds**: Ticks must be within valid range (`-887272` to `887272`)
5. **Tick Alignment**: Ticks must be aligned with `TickSpacing`
6. **Liquidity Amount**: Must be positive
7. **Fee Tier**: Must be a valid concentrated liquidity fee tier (0.01%, 0.05%, 0.3%, 1.0%)
8. **Tick Spacing**: Must match the fee tier's expected spacing

### Fee Tier Mapping

| Fee Tier | Tick Spacing | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 0.01%    | 1            | Ultra-low fee for stable pairs |
| 0.05%    | 10           | Low fee for stable pairs |
| 0.3%     | 60           | Medium fee for most pairs |
| 1.0%     | 200          | High fee for exotic pairs |

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing AMMs
- **No Impact**: Existing AMMs continue to function exactly as before
- **No Migration**: No need to migrate existing AMMs
- **Same API**: Existing RPC calls work unchanged

### New AMMs
- **Optional**: Concentrated liquidity is optional for new AMMs
- **Feature Gated**: Only available when feature flag is enabled
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be adopted gradually as needed

## Notes

This is a **hacky attempt** and is **not part of Ripple's long-term roadmap**. It's designed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how concentrated liquidity could be added to the existing AMM system with minimal breaking changes.

### What Was Removed
Since we're using the hybrid approach, we removed the redundant transaction type:
- ❌ `AMMConcentratedCreate` - Replaced by extending `AMMCreate`

### What We Keep (Hybrid Approach)
- ✅ `AMMCreate` - Extended with optional concentrated liquidity fields
- ✅ `AMMConcentratedDeposit` - Separate transaction for position management
- ✅ `AMMConcentratedWithdraw` - Separate transaction for position management  
- ✅ `AMMConcentratedCollect` - Separate transaction for fee collection

The approach prioritizes:
- **Backward compatibility** with existing AMMs
- **Minimal changes** to existing code
- **Feature flag control** for safe deployment
- **Gradual adoption** without forcing migration
