* Add writer::prepare(msg&) interface to set Content-Type

General:
* Use SFINAE on return values (search for "class =")

Boost.Http
* Use enum instead of bool in isRequest
* move version to a subclass of message

Docs:
* Include Example program listings in the docs
* Fix index in docs
* Figure out why namespace rfc2616 is included in docs
  (currently disabled via GENERATING_DOCS macro)
* melpon sandbox?
* Check DOXYGEN, GENERATIC_DOCS directives in source
  - See if we can include them now that xsl is fixed
* Implement cleanup-param to remove spaces around template arguments
  e.g. in basic_streambuf move constructor members

Core:
* Replace Jamroot with Jamfile
* Fix bidirectional buffers iterators operator->()
* Complete allocator testing in basic_streambuf, basic_headers

WebSocket:
* optimized versions of key/masking, choose prepared_key size
* invokable unit test
* Finish up all of static_string including tests
* Don't rely on default constructible mutable buffers
  type in read_frame_op (smb_type). To see the error, use
  boost::asio::streambuf in websocket_async_echo_peer

HTTP:
* Define Parser concept in HTTP
* trim public interface of rfc2616.h to essentials only
* add bool should_close(message_v1 const&) to replace the use
  of eof return value from write and async_write
* http type_check, e.g. is_WritableBody
* More fine grained parser errors
* HTTP parser size limit with test (configurable?)
* HTTP parser trailers with test
* URL parser, strong URL checking in HTTP parser
* Update for rfc7230
* Consider rename to MessageBody concept
