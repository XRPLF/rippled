## 1. Code of Conduct
Please abide by the rules while using and contributing to rippled. 

## 2. Setting up rippled

For contribution, install `rippled` on your local machine.
- [Linux](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/develop/Builds/linux) (Recommended)
- [Windows](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/develop/Builds/VisualStudio2017)
- [Mac](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/develop/Builds/macos)

## 3. How to contribute
One of the ways you could contribute to `rippled` is by:
- Reviewing the code | [Source code](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/tree/develop/src)
- Reporting bugs | [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)
- Issuing new feature request/ideas | [Issues](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues)

## 4. Explore before moving forward on your journey to contributing to the `rippled` software

- Developers trying to add new features
- Developers wanting to know about the code style used
- Developers wanting to know more about the databases
- Developers wanting to know more about `rippled` and the XRP Ledger

There are various sources where developers can visit to expand their knowledge about the XRP Ledger and rippled, here are the recommended ones: 

1. https://xrpl.org
2. https://thejohnfreeman.github.io/rippled/pages.html

Developers trying to commit changes to the source code can look into the `rippled`'s code tree and sub-tree. This can help you from getting any violations of branches while contributing. A page that has the rippled tree for version 1.5.0 is given here for your reference - [Page](https://thejohnfreeman.github.io/rippled/)

## 5. Bug bounty program
Ripple is sponsoring a bug bounty program for vulnerabilities in rippled (and other related projects, e.g: ripple-lib).
This program allows us to recognize and reward individuals or groups that identify and report bugs. 

In order to qualify for a bounty, the bug must be:

5.1. In Scope, only bugs in software under the scope of the program qualify. Currently, that means rippled and ripple-lib.

5.2. Relevancy, a security issue:
- User funds in danger
- Privacy related issues
- Consensus related issues
- The operation of the XRP Ledger

5.3. Originality and unknown, bugs that are already known/discussed in public do not qualify. Previously reported bugs, even if publicly unknown, are not eligible.

5.4. Specific. We welcome general security advice or recommendations, but we cannot pay bounties for that.

5.5. Fixable, there has to be something we can do to permanently fix the problem. Note that bugs in other people’s software may still qualify in some cases. For example, if you find a bug in a library that we use which can compromises the security of the `rippled` software that is in scope and fixable, you may qualify for a bounty.

5.6. Unused, If you use the exploit to attack the XRP Ledger, you do not qualify for a bounty. If you report a vulnerability used in an ongoing or past attack and there is specific, concrete evidence that suggests you are the attacker we reserve the right not to pay a bounty.

Note that, the amount paid varies dramatically. Vulnerabilities that are harmless on their own, but could form part of a critical exploit will usually receive a bounty. Full-blown exploits can receive much higher bounties. Please don’t hold back partial vulnerabilities while trying to construct a full-blown exploit. We will pay a bounty to anyone who reports a complete chain of vulnerabilities even if they have reported each component of the exploit separately and those vulnerabilities have been fixed in the meantime. However, to qualify for a the full bounty, you must to have been the first to report each of the partial exploits.
