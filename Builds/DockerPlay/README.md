# DockerPlay : what is this ?

Setup a working rippled development and testing environment inside Docker containers, without the need to install tools and libraries (such as gcc5) on any systems supporting Docker.

Basic idea: being able to edit rippled source files with our favorite tools and then build, test and run rippled (standalone or multi node network) inside docker containers. 

# What do you need to use these containers ?

* A system with docker installed (validated on Linux (Debian Jessie), to be validated on OSX and Windows).
* A clone of this repo if not done already. 
  * We will define the path where you cloned it as RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT.
  * We will define DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT as RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/Builds/DockerPlay.


# How to use ?

## Build Rippled from scratch

```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde build
...

Install file: "build/gcc.release/rippled" as "build/rippled"
scons: done building targets.
```

## Start your fresh Rippled

```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde start [name - default: standalone]

# Behind the scene :

## Overview

This tool will build three type of docker images :

* rippled-builder (~800MB) : a docker image with gcc5 and rippled development dependencies as defined in DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledBuilder/Dockerfile.  
* rippled-runner (~250MB) : a docker image with rippled run dependencies as defined in DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/Dockerfile.
* rippled-tester (~350MB) : a docker image with rippled run dependencies and nodejs as defined in DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledTester/Dockerfile. 

**Also notice on each docker images a rippled user is created to fit your host user uid/gid (Debian users generally have (uid,gid)=(1000,1000) but you're free to change the Dockerfile files to fit your environment).**

This tool will then run containers based on these images. As the working volumes are mounted from your cloned git repository in your host you can reuse these containers multiple time to build, run and test rippled.

## Build Rippled from scratch

* Run a container called rippled-builder with following volume: 
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT:/RIPPLED:rw

If the container already exists then start it. The container will build rippled and stop.

* When done and if no error you will find your fresh rippled binary in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build.

## Start your fresh Rippled

* If no rippled file found in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build directory exit.

* If you do not provide a name for your rippled instance default is "standalone". In such case rdde will :
  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.cfg exists if not will copy DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.tpl.cfg in to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.cfg.
  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/validators.txt exists if not will copy RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/doc/validators-example.txt to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/$NAME/validators.txt

* If you do provide a name for your rippled instance the script behavior will not change so much but you will have to provides configuration template yourself at least. In such case rdde script will : 

  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.cfg exists. If not will copy DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.tpl.cfg in to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.cfg. 

    **If DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.tpl.cfg doesn't exist then script exit with error.**

  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/validators.txt exists if not will copy  RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/doc/validators-example.txt to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/validators.txt

* Run a container called rippled-[name - default: standalone] with following volume:
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build/:/RIPPLED/bin:ro
  * DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]:/RIPPLED/etc:ro
  * DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/data/\[name\]:/RIPPLED/data:rw

If the container already exists (and not started already) then start it. The container will start rippled with provided configuration.

* NOTE : following files/directories are ignored in rippled repo : 
  * rippled.cfg
  * validators.txt
  * Builds/DockerPlay/RippledRunner/data/*/db
  * Builds/DockerPlay/RippledRunner/data/*/log

### TODO :

* customize rippled starting parameters thanks docker environment variables.
* use docker-compose to setup multi rippled testing environment. 

## Test your fresh Rippled

* If no rippled file found in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build directory exit.

* Run a container called rippled-tester with following volume
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT:/RIPPLED:rw

If the container already exists then start it. The container will install node dependencies modules if not done already and run rippled unit tests.

### TODO :

* customize unit test to run through docker environment variables.
