# DockerPlay : what is this ?

As a lucky Debian Jessie user some of us are missing an impotant stack to play with rippled from the sources : gcc5. Instead of hacking our working station (and potentially break it) we can setup a rippled development environment thanks docker. 

Basic idea: being able to edit rippled source files with our favorite tools and then build, test and run rippled inside docker containers. 

# What do you need to play ?

* A Linux system with docker installed.
* A clone of this repo if not done already. 
  * We will define the path where you cloned it as RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT.
  * We will define DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT as RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/Builds/DockerPlay.

# How to play ?

## Build Rippled from scratch

### Short bootstrap : 
```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde build

...

Install file: "build/gcc.release/rippled" as "build/rippled"
scons: done building targets.
```

### Behind the scene :

* Build a docker image called rippled-builder as defined in DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledBuilder/Dockerfile. 

Also notice a rippled user is created to fit your host user uid/gid (Debian users generally have (uid,gid)=(1000:1000) but you're free to change the Dockerfile to fit your environment).

If the rippled-builder image already exists skip this step.

* Run a container called rippled-builder with following volume: 
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT:/RIPPLED:rw

**This setup allow you to reuse the same container to build rippled after any source file changes.**

If the container already exists then start it. The container will build rippled and stop.

* When done and if no error you will find your fresh rippled binary in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build.


## Start your fresh Rippled

### Short bootstrap : 
```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde start [name - default: standalone]

...

```

### Behind the scene : 

* If no rippled file found in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build directory exit.

* If you do not provide a name provided for your rippled instance default is "standalone". In such case rdde will :
  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.cfg exists if not will copy DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.tpl.cfg in to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/rippled.cfg.
  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/standalone/validators.txt exists if not will copy RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/doc/validators-example.txt to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/$NAME/validators.txt

* If you do provide a name for your rippled instance the script behavior will not change so much but you will have to provides configuration template yourself at least. In such case rdde script will : 

  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.cfg exists. If not will copy DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.tpl.cfg in to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.cfg. 

**If DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/rippled.tpl.cfg doesn't exist then script exit with error.**

  * look if DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/validators.txt exists if not will copy  RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/doc/validators-example.txt to DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]/validators.txt

* Build a docker image called rippled-runner based on DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/Dockerfile. 

Also notice a rippled user is created to fit your host user uid/gid (Debian users has generally (uid,gid)=(1000:1000) but you're free to change the Dockerfile to fit your environment).

If the rippled-runner image already exists skip this step.

* Run a container called rippled-[name - default: standalone] with following volume:
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build/:/RIPPLED/bin:ro
  * DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/etc/\[name\]:/RIPPLED/etc:ro
  * DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledRunner/data/\[name\]:/RIPPLED/data:rw

**This setup allow you to reuse the same container to run rippled after any build.**

If the container already exists then start it if not started already. The container will start rippled.

* NOTE : following files/directories are ignored in rippled repo : 
  * rippled.cfg
  * validators.txt
  * Builds/DockerPlay/RippledRunner/data/*/db
  * Builds/DockerPlay/RippledRunner/data/*/log


### TODO :

* customize rippled starting parameters thanks docker environment variables.
* use docker-compose to setup multi rippled testing environment. 

## Stop your fresh Rippled

### Short bootstrap : 
```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde stop [name - default: standalone]
```

### Behind the scene : 
Simply stop rippled-\[name - default: standalone\] container. To remove the container use docker rm command...

## Test your fresh Rippled

### Short bootstrap : 
```
DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/rdde test

...

56.0s, 127 suites, 589 cases, 333514 tests total, 0 failures

...

  190 passing (44s)
  27 pending
```

### Behind the scene : 

* If no rippled file found in RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT/build directory exit.

* Build a docker image called rippled-tester based on DOCKER_PLAY_ROOT/RippledTester/Dockerfile. 

Also notice a rippled user is created to fit your host user uid/gid (Debian users has generally (uid,gid)=(1000:1000) but you're free to change the Dockerfile to fit your environment).

If the rippled-tester image already exists skip this step.

* Run a container called rippled-tester with following volume
  * RIPPLED_REPO_ROOT:/RIPPLED:rw

**This setup allow you to reuse the same container to test rippled after any build.**
If the container already exists then start it. The container will install node dependencies modules if not done already and run rippled unit tests.

### TODO :

* customize unit test to run through docker environment variables.
