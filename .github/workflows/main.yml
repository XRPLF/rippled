# This workflow runs all workflows to check, build and test the project on
# various Linux flavors, as well as MacOS and Windows.
name: Main

# This workflow is triggered on every push to the repository, including pull
# requests. However, it will not run if the pull request is a draft unless it
# has the 'DraftRunCI' label. As GitHub Actions does not support such `if`
# conditions here, the individual jobs will check the pull request state and
# labels to determine whether to run or not. The workflows called by the jobs
# may also have their own conditions to partially or completely skip execution
# as needed.
