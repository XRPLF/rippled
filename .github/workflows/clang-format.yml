          PREAMBLE: |
            If you are reading this, you are looking at a failed Github Actions
            job.  That means you pushed one or more files that did not conform
            to the formatting specified in .clang-format. That may be because
            you neglected to run 'git clang-format' or 'clang-format' before
            committing, or that your version of clang-format has an
            incompatibility with the one on this
            machine, which is:
          SUGGESTION: |

            To fix it, you can do one of two things:
            1. Download and apply the patch generated as an artifact of this
               job to your repo, commit, and push.
            2. Run 'git-clang-format --extensions cpp,h,hpp,ipp develop'
               in your repo, commit, and push.
        run: |
          echo "${PREAMBLE}"
          clang-format --version
          echo "${SUGGESTION}"
          exit 1
