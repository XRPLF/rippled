# This workflow runs all workflows to build the dependencies required for the
# project on various Linux flavors, as well as on MacOS and Windows, on a
# scheduled basis, on merge into the 'develop', 'release', or 'master' branches,
# or manually. The missing commits check is only run when the code is merged
# into the 'develop' or 'release' branches, and the documentation is built when
# the code is merged into the 'develop' branch.
