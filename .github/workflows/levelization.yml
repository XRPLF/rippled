        MESSAGE: |
          If you are reading this, you are looking at a failed Github
          Actions job. That means you changed the dependency relationships
          between the modules in rippled. That may be an improvement or a
          regression. This check doesn't judge.

          A rule of thumb, though, is that if your changes caused
          something to be removed from loops.txt, that's probably an
          improvement. If something was added, it's probably a regression.

          To fix it, you can do one of two things:
          1. Download and apply the patch generated as an artifact of this
             job to your repo, commit, and push.
          2. Run './Builds/levelization/levelization.sh' in your repo,
             commit, and push.

          See Builds/levelization/README.md for more info.
