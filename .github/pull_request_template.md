<!--
This PR template helps you to write a good pull request description.
Please feel free to include additional useful information even beyond what is requested below.

If your branch is on a personal fork and has a name that allows it to
run CI build/test jobs (e.g. "ci/foo"), remember to rename it BEFORE
opening the PR.  This avoids unnecessary redundant test runs. Renaming
the branch after opening the PR will close the PR.

### Type of Change

<!--

- [ ] Refactor (non-breaking change that only restructures code)
- [ ] Performance (increase or change in throughput and/or latency)
- [ ] Tests (you added tests for code that already exists, or your new feature included in this PR)

- [ ] Chore (no impact to binary, e.g. `.gitignore`, formatting, dropping support for older tooling)
- [ ] Release

### API Impact

<!--
Please check [x] relevant options, delete irrelevant ones.

* If there is any impact to the public API methods (HTTP / WebSocket), please update https://github.com/xrplf/rippled/blob/develop/API-CHANGELOG.md
  * Update API-CHANGELOG.md and add the change directly in this PR by pushing to your PR branch.
* libxrpl: See https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/blob/develop/docs/build/depend.md
* Peer Protocol: See https://xrpl.org/peer-protocol.html
-->

- [ ] Public API: New feature (new methods and/or new fields)
- [ ] Public API: Breaking change (in general, breaking changes should only impact the next api_version)

## Before / After
If relevant, use this section for an English description of the change at a technical level.
If this change affects an API, examples should be included here.

For performance-impacting changes, please provide these details:
1. Is this a new feature, bug fix, or improvement to existing functionality?
2. What behavior/functionality does the change impact?
3. In what processing can the impact be measured? Be as specific as possible - e.g. RPC client call, payment transaction that involves LOB, AMM, caching, DB operations, etc.
4. Does this change affect concurrent processing - e.g. does it involve acquiring locks, multi-threaded processing, or async processing?
