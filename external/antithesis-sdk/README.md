# Antithesis C++ SDK

This library provides methods for C++ programs to configure the [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com) platform. It contains three kinds of functionality:
* Assertion macros that allow you to define test properties about your software or workload.
* Randomness functions for requesting both structured and unstructured randomness from the Antithesis platform.
* Lifecycle functions that inform the Antithesis environment that particular test phases or milestones have been reached.

For general usage guidance see the [Antithesis C++ SDK Documentation](https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/sdk/cpp/overview.html)
