    @li The entire header is written.

    This operation is implemented in terms of one or more calls to
    the stream's `async_write_some` functions, and is known as a
    <em>composed operation</em>. The program must ensure that the
    stream performs no other write operations until this operation
    completes.

    @param stream The stream to which the data is to be written.
    The type must support the @b `AsyncWriteStream` concept.

    @param msg The header to write. The object must remain valid
    at least until the completion handler is called; ownership is
    not transferred.

    @param handler The handler to be called when the operation
    completes. Copies will be made of the handler as required.
    The equivalent function signature of the handler must be:
    @code void handler(
        error_code const& error // result of operation
    ); @endcode
    Regardless of whether the asynchronous operation completes
    immediately or not, the handler will not be invoked from within
    this function. Invocation of the handler will be performed in a
    manner equivalent to using `boost::asio::io_service::post`.
