/** Adapter to trim the front of a `BufferSequence`.

    This adapter wraps a buffer sequence to create a new sequence
    which may be incrementally consumed. Bytes consumed are removed
    from the front of the buffer. The underlying memory is not changed,
    instead the adapter efficiently iterates through a subset of
    the buffers wrapped.

    The wrapped buffer is not modified, a copy is made instead.
    Ownership of the underlying memory is not transferred, the application
    is still responsible for managing its lifetime.

    @tparam BufferSequence The buffer sequence to wrap.

    @tparam ValueType The type of buffer of the final buffer sequence. This
    can be different from the buffer type of the wrapped sequence. For
    example, a `MutableBufferSequence` can be transformed into a
    consumable `ConstBufferSequence`. Violations of buffer const safety
    are not permitted, and will result in a compile error.
