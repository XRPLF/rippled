/** Writeable view to a ledger, for applying a transaction.

    This refinement of ReadView provides an interface where
    the SLE can be "checked out" for modifications and put
    back in an updated or removed state. Also added is an
    interface to provide contextual information necessary
    to calculate the results of transaction processing,
    including the metadata if the view is later applied to
    the parent (using an interface in the derived class).
    The context info also includes values from the base
    ledger such as sequence number and the network time.

    This allows implementations to journal changes made to
    the state items in a ledger, with the option to apply
    those changes to the base or discard the changes without
    affecting the base.

    Typical usage is to call read() for non-mutating
    operations.

    For mutating operations the sequence is as follows:

        // Add a new value
        v.insert(sle);

        // Check out a value for modification
        sle = v.peek(k);

        // Indicate that changes were made
        v.update(sle)

        // Or, erase the value
        v.erase(sle)

    The invariant is that insert, update, and erase may not
    be called with any SLE which belongs to different view.

     * Unlike IOU, MPT doesn't have bi-directional relationship with an issuer,
     * where a trustline limits an amount that can be issued to a holder.
     * Consequently, the credit step (last MPTEndpointStep or
     * BookStep buying MPT) might temporarily overflow OutstandingAmount.
     * Limiting of a step's output amount in this case is delegated to
     * the next step (in rev order). The next step always redeems when a holder
     * account sells MPT (first MPTEndpointStep or BookStep selling MPT).
     * In this case the holder account is only limited by the step's output
     * and it's available funds since it's transferring the funds from one
     * account to another account and doesn't change OutstandingAmount.
     * This doesn't apply to an offer owned by an issuer.
     * In this case the issuer sells or self debits and is increasing
     * OutstandingAmount. Ability to issue is limited by the issuer
     * originally available funds less already self sold MPT amounts (MPT sell
     * offer).
     * Consider an example:
     * - GW creates MPT(USD) with 1,000USD MaximumAmount.
     * - GW pays 950USD to A1.
     * - A1 creates an offer 100XRP(buy)/100USD(sell).
     * - GW creates an offer 100XRP(buy)/100USD(sell).
     * - A2 pays 200USD to A3 with sendMax of 200XRP.
     * Since the payment engine executes payments in reverse,
     * OutstandingAmount overflows in MPTEndpointStep: 950 + 200 = 1,150USD.
     * BookStep first consumes A1 offer. This reduces OutstandingAmount
     * by 100USD: 1,150 - 100 = 1,050USD. GW offer can only be partially
     * consumed because the initial available amount is 50USD = 1,000 - 950.
     * BookStep limits it's output to 150USD. This in turn limits A3's send
     * amount to 150XRP: A1 buys 100XRP and sells 100USD to A3. This doesn't
     * change OutstandingAmount. GW buys 50XRP and sells 50USD to A3. This
     * changes OutstandingAmount 10 1,000USD.
