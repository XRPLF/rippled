/** Identifiers for on-ledger objects.

    Each ledger object requires a unique type identifier, which is stored
    within the object itself; this makes it possible to iterate the entire
    ledger and determine each object's type and verify that the object you
    retrieved from a given hash matches the expected type.

    @warning Since these values are stored inside objects stored on the ledger
             they are part of the protocol. **Changing them should be avoided
             because without special handling, this will result in a hard
   fork.**

    @note Values outside this range may be used internally by the code for
          various purposes, but attempting to use such values to identify
          on-ledger objects will results in an invariant failure.

    @note When retiring types, the specific values should not be removed but
          should be marked as [[deprecated]]. This is to avoid accidental
          reuse of identifiers.

    @todo The C++ language does not enable checking for duplicate values
          here. If it becomes possible then we should do this.
