/** A shared intrusive pointer class that supports weak pointers.

    This is meant to be used for SHAMapInnerNodes, but may be useful for other
    cases. Since the reference counts are stored on the pointee, the pointee is
    not destroyed until both the strong _and_ weak pointer counts go to zero.
    When the strong pointer count goes to zero, the "partialDestructor" is
    called. This can be used to destroy as much of the object as possible while
    still retaining the reference counts. For example, for SHAMapInnerNodes the
    children may be reset in that function. Note that std::shared_poiner WILL
    run the destructor when the strong count reaches zero, but may not free the
    memory used by the object until the weak count reaches zero. In rippled, we
    typically allocate shared pointers with the `make_shared` function. When
    that is used, the memory is not reclaimed until the weak count reaches zero.
