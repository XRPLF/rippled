    /** `refCounts` consists of four fields that are treated atomically:

         1. Strong count. This is a count of the number of shared pointers that
         hold a reference to this object. When the strong counts goes to zero,
         if the weak count is zero, the destructor is run. If the weak count is
         non-zero when the strong count goes to zero then the partialDestructor
         is run.

         2. Weak count. This is a count of the number of weak pointer that hold
         a reference to this object. When the weak count goes to zero and the
         strong count is also zero, then the destructor is run.

         3. Partial destroy started bit. This bit is set if the
         `partialDestructor` function has been started (or is about to be
         started). This is used to prevent the destructor from running
         concurrently with the partial destructor. This can easily happen when
         the last strong pointer release its reference in one thread and starts
         the partialDestructor, while in another thread the last weak pointer
         goes out of scope and starts the destructor while the partialDestructor
         is still running. Both a start and finished bit is needed to handle a
         corner-case where the last strong pointer goes out of scope, then then
         last `weakPointer` goes out of scope, but this happens before the
         `partialDestructor` bit is set. It would be possible to use a single
         bit if it could also be set atomically when the strong count goes to
         zero and the weak count is non-zero, but that would add complexity (and
         likely slow down common cases as well).

         4. Partial destroy finished bit. This bit is set when the
         `partialDestructor` has finished running. See (3) above for more
         information.
