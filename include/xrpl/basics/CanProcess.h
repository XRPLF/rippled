/** RAII class to check if an Item is already being processed on another thread,
 * as indicated by it's presence in a Collection.
 *
 * If the Item is not in the Collection, it will be added under lock in the
 * ctor, and removed under lock in the dtor. The object will be considered
 * "usable" and evaluate to `true`.
 *
 * If the Item is in the Collection, no changes will be made to the collection,
 * and the CanProcess object will be considered "unusable".
 *
 * It's up to the caller to decide what "usable" and "unusable" mean. (e.g.
 * Process or skip a block of code, or set a flag.)
 *
 * The current use is to avoid lock contention that would be involved in
 * processing something associated with the Item.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * void IncomingLedgers::acquireAsync(LedgerHash const& hash, ...)
 * {
 *    if (CanProcess check{acquiresMutex_, pendingAcquires_, hash})
 *    {
 *      acquire(hash, ...);
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * bool
 * NetworkOPsImp::recvValidation(
 *   std::shared_ptr<STValidation> const& val,
 *   std::string const& source)
 *   {
 *       CanProcess check(
 *           validationsMutex_, pendingValidations_, val->getLedgerHash());
 *       BypassAccept bypassAccept =
 *           check.canProcess() ? BypassAccept::no : BypassAccept::yes;
 *       handleNewValidation(app_, val, source, bypassAccept, m_journal);
 *   }
