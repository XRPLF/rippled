/** Provides message-oriented functionality using HTTP.

    The stream class template provides asynchronous and blocking
    message-oriented functionality necessary for clients and servers
    to utilize the HTTP protocol.

    @par Thread Safety
    @e Distinct @e objects: Safe.@n
    @e Shared @e objects: Unsafe. The application must ensure that
    all asynchronous operations are performed within the same
    implicit or explicit strand.

    @par Example

    To use the class template with an `ip::tcp::socket`, you would write:

    @code
    http::stream<ip::tcp::socket> hs(io_service);
    @endcode
    Alternatively, you can write:
    @code
    ip::tcp::socket sock(io_service);
    http::stream<ip::tcp::socket&> hs(sock);
    @endcode

    @note A stream object must not be destroyed while there are
    pending asynchronous operations associated with it.

    @par Concepts
    AsyncReadStream, AsyncWriteStream, Stream, SyncReadStream, SyncWriteStream.
