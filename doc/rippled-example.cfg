#
# Purpose
#
#   This file documents and provides examples of all rippled server process
#   configuration options. When the rippled server instance is lanched, it looks
#   for a file with the following name:
#
#     rippled.cfg
#
#   For more information on where the rippled serer instance searches for
#   the file please visit the Ripple wiki. Specifically, the section explaining
#   the --conf command line option:
#
#     https://ripple.com/wiki/Rippled#--conf.3Dpath
#
#   This file should be named rippled.cfg.  This file is UTF-8 with Dos, UNIX,
#   or Mac style end of lines.  Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are
#   ignored. Undefined sections are reserved. No escapes are currently defined.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Peer Networking
#
#-------------------
#
#   These settings control security and access attributes of the Peer to Peer
#   server section of the rippled process. Peer Networking implements the
#   Ripple Payment protocol. It is over peer connections that transactions
#   and validations are passed from to machine to machine, to make up the
#   components of closed ledgers.
#
#
#
# [ips]
#
#   List of ips where the Ripple protocol is served.  For a starter list,
#   you can copy entries from: https://ripple.com/ripple.txt
#
#   Domain names are not allowed. One ipv4 or ipv6 address per line.  A port
#   may optionally be specified after adding a space to the address.  By
#   convention, if known, IPs are listed in from most to least trusted.
#
#   Examples:
#    192.168.0.1
#    192.168.0.1 3939
#    2001:0db8:0100:f101:0210:a4ff:fee3:9566
#
#   Here's the recent set of good, well known addresses:
#
#   [ips]
#     54.225.112.220 51235
#     54.225.123.13  51235
#     54.227.239.106 51235
#     107.21.251.218 51235
#     184.73.226.101 51235
#     23.23.201.55   51235
#
#
#
# [ips_fixed]
#
#   List of IP addresses to which rippled should always maintain peer
#   connections with. This is useful for manually forming private networks,
#   for example to configure a validation server that connects to the
#   Ripple network through a public-facing server, or for building a set
#   of cluster peers.
#
#
#
# [peer_ip]
#
#   IP address or domain to bind to allow external connections from peers.
#   Defaults to not binding, which disallows external connections from peers.
#
#   Examples: 0.0.0.0 - Bind on all interfaces.
#
#
#
# [peer_port]
#
#   If peer_ip is supplied, corresponding port to bind to for peer connections.
#
#
#
# [peer_port_proxy]
#
#   An optional, additional listening port number for peers. Incoming
#   connections on this port will be required to provide a PROXY Protocol
#   handshake, described in this document (external link):
#
#       http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
# 
#   The PROXY Protocol is a popular method used by elastic load balancing
#   service providers such as Amazon, to identify the true IP address and
#   port number of external incoming connections.
#
#   In addition to enabling this setting, it will also be required to
#   use your provider-specific control panel or administrative web page
#   to configure your server instance to receive PROXY Protocol handshakes,
#   and also to restrict access to your instance to the Elastic Load Balancer.
#
# [peer_private]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Request peers to broadcast your address. Normal outbound peer connections [default]
#   1: Request peers not broadcast your address. Only connect to configured peers.
#
#
#
# [peer_ssl_cipher_list]
#
#   A colon delimited string with the allowed SSL cipher modes for peer. The
#   choices for for ciphers are defined by the OpenSSL API function
#   SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list, documented here (external link):
#
#   http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tpfhelp/current/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.ztpf-ztpfdf.doc_put.cur%2Fgtpc2%2Fcpp_ssl_ctx_set_cipher_list.html
#
#   The default setting is "ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:@STRENGTH", which allows
#   non-authenticated peer connections (they are, however, secure).
#
#
#
# [node_seed]
#
#   This is used for clustering. To force a particular node seed or key, the
#   key can be set here.  The format is the same as the validation_seed field.
#   To obtain a validation seed, use the validation_create command.
#
#   Examples:  RASH BUSH MILK LOOK BAD BRIM AVID GAFF BAIT ROT POD LOVE
#              shfArahZT9Q9ckTf3s1psJ7C7qzVN
#
#
#
# [cluster_nodes]
#
#   To extend full trust to other nodes, place their node public keys here.
#   Generally, you should only do this for nodes under common administration.
#   Node public keys start with an 'n'. To give a node a name for identification
#   place a space after the public key and then the name.
#
#
#
# [sntp_servers]
#
#   IP address or domain of NTP servers to use for time synchronization.
#
#   These NTP servers are suitable for rippled servers located in the United
#   States:
#      time.windows.com
#      time.apple.com
#      time.nist.gov
#      pool.ntp.org
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 2. Websocket Networking
#
#------------------------
#
#   These settings control security and access attributes of the Websocket
#   server section of the rippled process, primarily used to service
#   client requests and backend applications.
#
#
#
# [websocket_public_ip]
#
#   IP address or domain to bind to allow untrusted connections from clients.
#   In the future, this option will go away and the peer_ip will accept
#   websocket client connections.
#
#   Examples: 0.0.0.0 - Bind on all interfaces.
#             127.0.0.1 - Bind on localhost interface.  Only local programs may connect.
#
#
#
# [websocket_public_port]
#
#   Port to bind to allow untrusted connections from clients.  In the future,
#   this option will go away and the peer_ip will accept websocket client
#   connections.
#
#
#
# [websocket_public_secure]
#
#   0, 1 or 2.
#   0: Provide ws service for websocket_public_ip/websocket_public_port.
#   1: Provide both ws and wss service for websocket_public_ip/websocket_public_port. [default]
#   2: Provide wss service only for websocket_public_ip/websocket_public_port.
#
#   Browser pages like the Ripple client will not be able to connect to a secure
#   websocket connection if a self-signed certificate is used.  As the Ripple
#   reference client currently shares secrets with its server, this should be
#   enabled.
#
#
#
# [websocket_ping_frequency]
#
#   <number>
#
#   The amount of time to wait in seconds, before sending a websocket 'ping'
#   message. Ping messages are used to determine if the remote end of the
#   connection is no longer availabile.
#   
#
#
# [websocket_ip]
#
#   IP address or domain to bind to allow trusted ADMIN connections from backend
#   applications.
#
#   Examples: 0.0.0.0 - Bind on all interfaces.
#             127.0.0.1 - Bind on localhost interface.  Only local programs may connect.
#
#
#
# [websocket_port]
#
#   Port to bind to allow trusted ADMIN connections from backend applications.
#
#
#
# [websocket_secure]
#
#   0, 1, or 2.
#   0: Provide ws service only for websocket_ip/websocket_port. [default]
#   1: Provide ws and wss service for websocket_ip/websocket_port
#   2: Provide wss service for websocket_ip/websocket_port.
#
#
#
# [websocket_ssl_cert]
#
#   Specify the path to the SSL certificate file in PEM format.
#   This is not needed if the chain includes it.
#
#
#
# [websocket_ssl_chain]
#
#   If you need a certificate chain, specify the path to the certificate chain
#   here.  The chain may include the end certificate.
#
#
#
# [websocket_ssl_key]
#
#   Specify the filename holding the SSL key in PEM format.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 3. RPC Networking
#
#------------------
#
#   This group of settings configures security and access attributes of the
#   RPC server section of the rippled process, used to service both local
#   an optional remote clients.
#
#
#
# [rpc_allow_remote]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Allow RPC connections only from 127.0.0.1. [default]
#   1: Allow RPC connections from any IP.
#
#
#
# [rpc_admin_allow]
#
#   Specify an list of IP addresses allowed to have admin access. One per line.
#   If you want to test the output of non-admin commands add this section and
#   just put an ip address not under your control.
#   Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
#
#
#
# [rpc_admin_user]
#
#   As a server, require this as the admin user to be specified.  Also, require
#   rpc_admin_user and rpc_admin_password to be checked for RPC admin functions.
#   The request must specify these as the admin_user and admin_password in the
#   request object.
#
#   As a client, supply this to the server in the request object.
#
#
#
# [rpc_admin_password]
#
#   As a server, require this as the admin pasword to be specified.  Also,
#   require rpc_admin_user and rpc_admin_password to be checked for RPC admin
#   functions.  The request must specify these as the admin_user and
#   admin_password in the request object.
#
#   As a client, supply this to the server in the request object.
#
#
#
# [rpc_ip]
#
#   IP address or domain to bind to allow insecure RPC connections.
#   Defaults to not binding, which disallows RPC connections.
#
#
#
# [rpc_port]
#
#   If rpc_ip is supplied, corresponding port to bind to for peer connections.
#
#
#
# [rpc_user]
#
#   As a server, require a this user to specified and require rpc_password to
#   be checked for RPC access via the rpc_ip and rpc_port. The user and password
#   must be specified via HTTP's basic authentication method.
#   As a client, supply this to the server via HTTP's basic authentication
#   method.
#
#
#
# [rpc_password]
#
#   As a server, require a this password to specified and require rpc_user to
#   be checked for RPC access via the rpc_ip and rpc_port. The user and password
#   must be specified via HTTP's basic authentication method.
#   As a client, supply this to the server via HTTP's basic authentication
#   method.
#
#
#
# [rpc_startup]
#
#   Specify a list of RPC commands to run at startup.
#
#   Examples:
#     { "command" : "server_info" }
#     { "command" : "log_level", "partition" : "ripplecalc", "severity" : "trace" }
#
#
#
# [rpc_secure]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0: Server certificates are not provided for RPC clients using SSL [default]
#   1: Client RPC connections wil be provided with SSL certificates.
#
#   Note that if rpc_secure is enabled, it will also be necessasry to configure the
#   certificate file settings located in rpc_ssl_cert, rpc_ssl_chain, and rpc_ssl_key
#
#
#
# [rpc_ssl_cert]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#   A file system path leading to the SSL certificate file to use for secure RPC.
#   The file is in PEM format. The file is not needed if the chain includes it.
#
#
#
# [rpc_ssl_chain]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#   A file system path leading to the file with the certificate chain.
#   The chain may include the end certificate.
#
#
#
# [rpc_ssl_key]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#   A file system path leading to the file with the SSL key.
#   The file is in PEM format.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 4. SMS Gateway
#
#---------------
#
#   If you have a certain SMS messaging provider you can configure these
#   settings to allow the rippled server instance to send an SMS text to the
#   configured gateway in response to an admin-level RPC command "sms" with
#   one parameter, 'text' containing the message to send. This allows backend
#   applications to use the rippled instance to securely notify administrators
#   of custom events or information via SMS gateway.
#
#   When the 'sms' RPC command is issued, the configured SMS gateway will be
#   contacted via HTTPS GET at the URL indicated by sms_url. The URI formed
#   will be in this format:
#
#     [sms_url]?from=[sms_from]&to=[sms_to]&api_key=[sms_key]&api_secret=[sms_secret]&text=['text']
#
#   Where [...] are the corresponding valus from the configuration file, and
#   ['test'] is the value of the JSON field with name 'text'.
#
# [sms_url]
#
#   The URL to contact via HTTPS when sending SMS messages
#
# [sms_from]
# [sms_to]
# [sms_key]
# [sms_secret]
#
#   These are all strings passed directly in the URI as query parameters
#   to the provider of the SMS gateway.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 5. Ripple Protocol
#
#------------------
#
#   These settings affect the behavior of the server instance with respect
#   to Ripple payment protocol level activities such as validating and
#   closing ledgers, establishing a quorum, or adjusting fees in response
#   to server overloads.
#
#
#
# [node_size]
#
#   Tunes the servers based on the expected load and available memory. Legal
#   sizes are "tiny", "small", "medium", "large", and "huge". We recommend
#   you start at the default and raise the setting if you have extra memory.
#   The default is "tiny".
#
#
#
# [validation_quorum]
#
#   Sets the minimum number of trusted validations a ledger must have before
#   the server considers it fully validated. Note that if you are validating,
#   your validation counts.
#
#
#
# [ledger_history]
#
#   The number of past ledgers to acquire on server startup and the minimum to
#   maintain while running.
#
#   To serve clients, servers need historical ledger data. Servers that don't
#   need to serve clients can set this to "none".  Servers that want complete
#   history can set this to "full".
#
#   The default is: 256
#
#
#
# [validation_seed]
#
#   To perform validation, this section should contain either a validation seed
#   or key.  The validation seed is used to generate the validation
#   public/private key pair.  To obtain a validation seed, use the
#   validation_create command.
#
#   Examples:  RASH BUSH MILK LOOK BAD BRIM AVID GAFF BAIT ROT POD LOVE
#              shfArahZT9Q9ckTf3s1psJ7C7qzVN
#
#
#
# [validators]
#
#   List of nodes to always accept as validators. Nodes are specified by domain
#   or public key.
#
#   For domains, rippled will probe for https web servers at the specified
#   domain in the following order: ripple.DOMAIN, www.DOMAIN, DOMAIN
#
#   For public key entries, a comment may optionally be spcified after adding a
#   space to the pulic key.
#
#   Examples:
#    ripple.com
#    n9KorY8QtTdRx7TVDpwnG9NvyxsDwHUKUEeDLY3AkiGncVaSXZi5
#    n9MqiExBcoG19UXwoLjBJnhsxEhAZMuWwJDRdkyDz1EkEkwzQTNt John Doe
#
#
#
# [validators_file]
#
#   Path to file contain a list of nodes to always accept as validators. Use
#   this to specify a file other than this file to manage your validators list.
#
#   If this entry is not present or empty and no nodes from previous runs were
#   found in the database, rippled will look for a validators.txt in the config
#   directory.  If not found there, it will attempt to retrieve the file from
#   the [validators_site] web site.
#
#   After specifying a different [validators_file] or changing the contents of
#   the validators file, issue a RPC unl_load command to have rippled load the
#   file.
#
#   Specify the file by specifying its full path.
#
#   Examples:
#    C:/home/johndoe/ripple/validators.txt
#    /home/johndoe/ripple/validators.txt
#
#
#
# [validators_site]
#
#   Specifies where to find validators.txt for UNL boostrapping and RPC
#   unl_network command.
#
#   Example: ripple.com
#
#
#
# [path_search]
#   When searching for paths, the default search aggressiveness. This can take
#   exponentially more resources as the size is increased.
#
#   The default is: 7
#
# [path_search_fast]
# [path_search_max]
#   When seaching for paths, the minimum and maximum search aggressiveness.
#
#   The default for 'path_search_fast' is 2. The default for 'path_search_max' is 10.
#
# [path_search_old]
#
#   For clients that use the legacy path finding interfaces, the search
#   agressiveness to use. The default is 7.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 6. HTTPS Client
#
#----------------
#
#   The rippled server instance uses HTTPS GET requests in a variety of
#   circumstances, including but not limited to the SMS Messaging Gateway
#   feature and also for contacting trusted domains to fetch information
#   such as mapping an email address to a Ripple Payment Network address.
#
# [ssl_verify]
#
#   0 or 1.
#
#   0. HTTPS client connections will not verify certificates.
#   1. Certificates will be checked for HTTPS client connections  .
#
#
#
# [ssl_verify_file]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#   A file system path leading to the certificate verification file for
#   HTTPS client requests.
#
#
#
# [ssl_verify_dir]
#
#   <pathname>
#
#
#   A file system path leading to a file or directory containing the root
#   certificates that the server will accept for verifying HTTP servers.
#   Used only for outbound HTTPS client connections.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 7. Database
#
#------------
#
#   rippled creates 4 SQLite database to hold bookkeeping information
#   about transactions, local credentials, and various other things.
#   It also creates the NodeDB, which holds all the objects that
#   make up the current and historical ledgers. The size of the NodeDB
#   grows in proportion to the amount of new data and the amount of
#   historical data (a configurable setting).
#
#   The performance of the underlying storage media where the NodeDB
#   is placed can affect the performance of the server. Some virtual
#   hosting providers offer high speed secondary storage, with the
#   caveat that the data is not persisted across launches. If rippled
#   runs in such an environment, it can be beneficial to configure the
#   temp_db setting, which activates a secondary "look-aside" cache
#   that can speed up the server. Some testing is suggested to determine
#   if the temp_db setting is an improvement for your environment
#
#   Partial pathnames will be considered relative to the location of
#   the rippled.cfg file.
#
#   [node_db]       Settings for the NodeDB (required)
#   [temp_db]       Settings for the look-aside temporary db (optional)
#   [import_db]     Settings for performing a one-time import (optional)
#
#   Format (without spaces):
#       One or more lines of key / value pairs:
#       <key> '=' <value>
#       ...
#
#   Examples:
#       type=HyperLevelDB
#       path=db/hyperldb
#
#   Choices for 'type' (not case-sensitive)
#       HyperLevelDB        Use an improved version of LevelDB (preferred)
#       LevelDB             Use Google's LevelDB database (deprecated)
#       none                Use no backend
#       RocksDB             Use Facebook's RocksDB database
#       SQLite              Use SQLite
#
#   Required keys:
#       path                Location to store the database (all types)
#
#   Optional keys:
#       (none yet)
#
#   Notes:
#       The 'node_db' entry configures the primary, persistent storage.
#
#       The 'temp_db' configures a look-aside cache for high volume storage
#           which doesn't necessarily persist between server launches. This
#           is an optional configuration parameter. If it is left out then
#           no look-aside database is created or used.
#
#       The 'import_db' is used with the '--import' command line option to
#           migrate the specified database into the current database given
#           in the [node_db] section.
#
#   [database_path]   Path to the book-keeping databases.
#
#   There are 4 book-keeping SQLite database that the server creates and
#   maintains. If you omit this configuration setting, it will default to
#   creating a directory called "db" located in the same place as your
#   rippled.cfg file.
#
#
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 8. Diagnostics
#
#---------------
#
#   These settings are designed to help server administrators diagnose
#   problems, and obtain detailed information about the activities being
#   performed by the rippled process.
#
#
#
# [debug_logfile]
#
#   Specifies were a debug logfile is kept. By default, no debug log is kept.
#   Unless absolute, the path is relative the directory containing this file.
#
#   Example: debug.log
#
#
#
# [insight]
#
#   Configuration parameters for the Beast.Insight stats collection module.
#
#   Insight is a module that collects information from the areas of rippled
#   that have instrumentation. The configuration paramters control where the
#   collection metrics are sent. The parameters are expressed as key = value
#   pairs with no white space. The main parameter is the choice of server:
#
#     "server"
#
#       Choice of server to send metrics to. Currently the only choice is
#       "statsd" which sends UDP packets to a StatsD daemon, which must be
#       running while rippled is running. More information on StatsD is
#       available here:
#           https://github.com/b/statsd_spec
#
#       When server=statsd, these additional keys are used:
#
#       "address" The UDP address and port of the listening StatsD server,
#                 in the format, n.n.n.n:port.
#
#       "prefix"  A string prepended to each collected metric. This is used
#                 to distinguish between different running instances of rippled.
#
#     If this section is missing, or the server type is unspecified or unknown,
#     statistics are not collected or reported.
#
#   Example:
#
#     [insight]
#     server=statsd
#     address=192.168.0.95:4201
#     prefix=my_validator
