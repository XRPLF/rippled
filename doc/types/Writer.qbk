[section:Writer Writer requirements]

A `Writer` serializes the message body. The implementation creates an instance
of this type when serializing a message, and calls into it zero or more times
to provide buffers containing the data. The interface of `Writer` is intended
to allow serialization in these scenarios:

* A body that does not entirely fit in memory.
* A body produced incrementally from coroutine output.
* A body represented by zero or more buffers already in memory.
* A body as a series of buffers when the content size is not known ahead of time.
* Body data generated on demand from other threads.
* Body data computed algorithmically.

In this table:

* `X`  denotes a type meeting the requirements of `Writer`.

* `a`  denotes a value of type `X`.

* `m`  denotes a value of type `message const&` where
        `std::is_same<decltype(m.body), Body::value_type>:value == true`.

* `ec` is a value of type [link beast.ref.error_code `error_code&`]

* `wf` is a [*write function]: a function object of unspecified type provided
       by the implementation which accepts any value meeting the requirements
       of __ConstBufferSequence__ as its single parameter.

    [`X a(m);`]
    []
    [
        `a` is constructible from `m`. The lifetime of `m` is guaranteed
        to end no earlier than after `a` is destroyed. This function must
        be `noexcept`.
    ]
]
[
    [`a.init(ec)`]
    [`void`]
    [
        Called immediately after construction. If the function sets an
        error code in `ec`, the serialization is aborted and the error
        is propagated to the caller. This function must be `noexcept`.
    ]
]
[
    [`a.content_length()`]
    [`std::uint64_t`]
    [
        If this member is present, it is called after initialization
        and before calls to provide buffers. The serialized message will
        have the Content-Length field set to the value returned from
        this function. If this member is absent, the serialized message
        body will be chunk-encoded for HTTP versions 1.1 and later, else
        the serialized message body will be sent unmodified, with the
        error `boost::asio::error::eof` returned to the caller, to notify
        they should close the connection to indicate the end of the message.
        This function must be `noexcept`.
    ]
]
[
    [`a.write(ec, wf)`]
    [`bool`]
    [
        Called repeatedly after `init` succeeds. `wf` is a function object
        which takes as its single parameter any value meeting the requirements
        of __ConstBufferSequence__. Buffers provided to this write function
        must remain valid until the next member function of `writer` is
        invoked (which may be the destructor). This function returns `true`
        to indicate all message body data has been written, or `false` if
        there is more body data.

[note
    Definitions for required `Writer` member functions should be declared
    inline so the generated code can become part of the implementation.

Exemplar:

public:
    /** Construct the writer.

        The msg object is guaranteed to exist for the lifetime of the writer.

        Exceptions:
            No-throw guarantee.

        @param msg The message whose body is to be written.
    */
    template<bool isRequest, class Body, class Headers>
    explicit
    writer(message<isRequest, Body, Headers> const& msg) noexcept;

    /** Initialize the writer.

        Called once immediately after construction.
        The writer can perform initialization which may fail.

        @param ec Contains the error code if any errors occur.
    */
    void
    init(error_code& ec) noexcept;

    /** Returns the content length.

        If this member is present, the implementation will set the
        Content-Length field accordingly. If absent, the implementation will
        use chunk-encoding or terminate the connection to indicate the end
        of the message.
    */
    std::uint64_t
    content_length() noexcept;

    /** Write zero or one buffer representing the message body.

        Postconditions:

            If return value is `true`:
                * Callee made zero or one calls to `write`.
                * There is no more data remaining to write.

            If return value is `false`:
                * Callee does not take ownership of resume.
                * Callee made one call to `write`.

        @param ec Set to indicate an error. This will cause an
        asynchronous write operation to complete with the error.

        @param write A functor the writer will call to provide the next
        set of buffers. Ownership of the buffers is not transferred,
        the writer must guarantee that the buffers remain valid until the
        next member function is invoked, which may be the destructor.

        @return `true` if there is no more data to send,
                `false` when there may be more data.
